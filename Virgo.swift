    Virgo has the symbol of 'The Virgin', but the similarity ends there itself. People born under the zodiac sign of Virgo are very devoted to their families. They are not much talkative and mostly stand away from a crowd. However, they will be noticing even the smallest detail. The typical Virgo personality traits include perfectionism. Everything around him has to be just perfect. He is one of those who prefer carrying the exact amount of change for the bread, rather than asking the shopkeeper for a change. He is not much of a party bird, because he basically dislikes crowd.
    Virgos live in the real world. They neither dayÂ­dream, nor wish on stars. One look at them and you will feel that they are overburdened with some worries. However, worrying symbolizes their characteristic profile. Infact, Virgo seems to be on the lookout for it. A Virgo is very conscious of his looks and he will spend hours in front of the mirror getting the crease on his trousers just right. Everything about him has to be perfect, right from the clothes to the perfume. Virgos have this peculiar habit of taking on more work that they can easily manage.
    Then, they strain themselves beyond limits, often leading to frayed nerves. They may look pretty cool on the outside, but inside, they will be extremely anxious. One thing you can be sure of while dealing with a Virgo, he is totally dependable and sincere. He may lie once in a while, especially when he doesn't want to go somewhere or do something. However, the lie will be totally harmless. A Virgo is highly critical of the people around him. Everything related to him, including his lover, has to go through his forever-analyzing eyes.
    He is finicky about cleanliness, cannot tolerate lazy behavior, hates procrastination and is never blind to flaws and faults, even of his loved ones.He is also quite particular about each and every detail. However, that does not mean Virgos do not have a humorous side. It's just that as they hate impropriety, they also cannot tolerate sloppiness. If such things do some across them, they become irritable and snappy. However, composure, patience, caring attitude and endurance define their true personality.
    He may criticize you for your faults, but if you are in trouble, he will be the first person to help you fix up everything. Don't mention a Virgo's overly critical attitude in front of him; he will be the first one to deny it. He also seems to be totally blind to his own faults. Virgos have this habit of not being able to sit at the same place for too long and turning restless easily. If you are in love with a Virgo, remember that Virgos express their love with subtleness.
    You wont see them shouting 'I Love You' from the rooftop. However, that doesn't mean they are less dedicated than any other sun signs. They are just not able to express themselves fully and lack demonstrativeness. As much as a Virgo likes to help others, he finds it very difficult to accept favors. He likes to be self-dependent and hates to take obligations. He won't spend too much money on himself, but will be extravagant in case of his loved ones or for those who are in need.
    In such a case, don't waste the money or he will be hurt. As far a Virgo's critical nature is concerned, remember that it's just his nature. He was just born to notice even the slightest of faults. Infact, A Virgo is the most critical about himself. At the same time, he is very punctual and will not take lateness too lightly. To him, time is of extreme importance. Virgos like small, helpless creatures as much as they like honesty, punctuality, savings, caution and vigilance. They are like the true individualists who have their own, secret way of making the heart memorize.

    Being in love with a Virgo man means living in a practical world, where there will no be fairytale dreams. If you are too sentimental, then better take a u-turn right now. You will have to wait a long time to get him involved in a relationship. Even when he does, don't expect him to sing romantic poems for you or stand under your window to serenade you. It is not that Virgo men do not know how to love; just their way of expressing it is different from others. They are extremely dedicated towards their family and friends.
    They are constantly involved in helping them and have a strong sense of work and duty. Too much display of emotions makes them uncomfortable and too conscious. A Virgo male will stick to you when you need him the most, care for you and dutifully carry out all the responsibilities a husband is expected to do. However, don't burden him with extreme sentiments, mushy affection and tearful promises. If he doesn't run away, he will become too cold and even the subtle display of affection from his side may come to a stop.
    This doesn't mean that a Virgo guy cannot be softened at all. You have to keep the temperature just right. Too much aloofness or too much closeness is not what he wants. A little bit of sensuality, mixed with some intelligence and an interesting disposition is what he desires. To him, quality of time spent with you will mean more than the quantity. He is usually very cautious while forming a relationship. If it still doesn't turn out to be right, he will bury himself in work, avoid social gathering and be triply cautious with people.
    Virgo men do not run after girls and romance. Infact, they do not mind being single at all. So, you will have to make a Virgo realize that he has fallen in love and needs to form a relationship. Remember, subtlety is the key to all this. If he wants, he can seduce you very easily, while being subtle all the time. He is not prone to flirtations, so you have no reasons to doubts his intentions. Infact, he is too sensitive, selective and honest to indulge in such kind of behavior. The love of a Virgo man is clean, innocent and pure, though it may take some time to win it.
    Never expect him to fall in love with you at the first sight. He is very cautious about everything and that includes love and relationships. Lying will get you nowhere with him. He wants a genuine and honest relationship and cannot stand dishonesty even for a second. Stirring the emotions of a Virgo male is a very difficult task, because he never consciously looks for a mate. Remember, he does have a heart; you just have to sway it the right way. It may take time, but it will be worth the wait.
    Once you have won his heart, you will never again feel unloved or uncared for, in your entire life. His love will burn for you with a steady flame, which will never flicker even for a minute. You will be rewarded with a husband who is totally sincere, patient, dependable and forever loving. You will never have to worry about stability again, whether it is emotional or financial. A Virgo man is not at all prone to wandering and you will never ever have to keep an eye on him. You will practically be showered with care and concern, whenever you need them.
    He has a sharp memory and will remember even the minutest of details. You wouldn't have to remind him about anniversary or birthdays or other important dates. He may not understand why these days are so important to you, but he will remember them nonetheless. Virgo men are not too jealous, but they are possessive in the extreme. They very loyal and will expect the same from you. It is better to burn the love letters of your ex-boyfriends. Once something gets over for them, its over. Emotional appeals and tears wouldn't budge them an inch.
    So, better play on the safer side. A Virgo man doesn't like dumb females, who are ignorant and stupid. You may be the hottest babe in the block. But, if you do not have brains, he wouldn't even look at you. Impropriety and rudeness turns him off. So, forget wearing that short, revealing black dress of yours. His kind of female has to be clean - body, mind and soul. If you want to win the love of a Virgo male, make sure that you have impeccable manners, spotlessly clean house, excellent cooking skills and decent dressing sense. He is prone to finding faults in others, but please don't give him specifics reasons to do so in your case.
    He will be a very responsible father and will help sharpen the intellect of the children. He will also imbibe good manners, etiquettes and the quality of helping the needy in them. You will never need to worry about discipline, as he will work on that front too. However, you will have to teach your Virgo husband how to express his love and affection and control his critical behavior. When he becomes a little cranky, just leave him alone and he will again be his usual self pretty soon. With a Virgo man, you will have a tender companion who will shower you all with love and care, even when you don't look twenty anymore!

    One thing you need to know about a Virgo woman - she has guts and lots of them! It doesn't mean that she is not as shy and as reserved as she seems to be. It's just that she can do anything and everything for the people she loves. By love, she means real love, no other type of love exists for her. A Virgo female is a complete woman! She has all the charms and tricks that any other female has, but she is not weak. Infact, she has quite a determination and can do anything if she sets her mind to it.
    She will be completely devoted and loyal to you in a relationship. Still, if it doesn't seems to be working, she will severe all the ties and become as cold as the North Pole. Virgo women's characteristics profile is an odd mix of emotions and practicality, romance and common sense. When they fall in love, they show such extreme passion and intensity that only few other women can. Making them fall in love is, however, an entirely different task. They will demand total perfection from you, even though they may fall short in that arena.
    It's better to get used to their critical nature. A Virgo girl believes that she is extremely efficient and organized and what is more annoying is, that she is right. She is a stickler for time and it's better not to be late when you are meeting her. She will not break the new, expensive vase when she is upset, but she can be very demanding and fussy. If the fault is yours, admit that you are wrong and say it while handing her the flowers. Don't even try to argue, or she will lose her temper again.
    It is better to leave her alone for sometime and she will cool again. On the other hand, a Virgo woman will find it very hard to accept that she is wrong. The fact is, most of the time she's not. When you are courting her as well as after you get married, it is advisable to mind your manners. She cannot tolerate someone using abusive language, coming late, dressing sloppily, not minding table manners, etc. It's better to brush up your vocabulary too. She will not cling to you, nor will she become totally aloof.
    She is also very good with finances and extravagance is not one of her personality traits. A Virgo female cannot stand public displays of affection and it is better to be subtle in this area. Her taste is very good and her intellect quite developed. If you are trying to woo her, take her to places like theatre, art gallery, etc. Just like a typical Virgo, she is prone to worrying about things too much and she will do your part of the job too. She is very much attached to the ground and prefers to live in the real world.
    You let a Virgo female do her part of making things seem just perfect and she will keep you entertained with all her feminine charms. She is very sensitive and her feelings are pretty fragile, but she will become exceedingly strong when you need her support. With kids, she will be very considerate and you will never see them running around in their underclothes. She will be gentle, but firm and will demand complete discipline from them. Even though a Virgo woman is very critical, she will not take criticism very nicely. It never works the other way round for her.
    The reason for this is that she is as aware of her own imperfections as she is of yours. So, she doesn't need you to remind her of her own shortcomings every now and then. Instead of fretting over her perfectionism, you should feel blessed to have such a charming female who never makes your house look like a garbage dump. Your toast will never get burnt and your coffee will always taste just perfect. She has a witty side too and when she laughs, it seems like the ringing of little bells, doesn't it!

    A child born in September is usually more quiet, calm and peaceful than the other children. At the same time, he is also quite attentive, observant, quick and swift. A Virgo child will be very fussy about food and it is better if you do not try to feed him something he doesn't like. Otherwise, the food will end up on the floor, on the table, in the plate and everywhere, except his stomach. Apart from this, he will be a very pleasant child, who throws the minimum of tantrums. Cleanliness and neatness are the basic personality traits of a Virgo baby.
    You will not have to run after him to get his room cleaned, it will always be spick and span. He will not be too comfortable in front of strangers or a large crowd, but you will seldom find him sitting quietly in front of friends and family. It will be very easy to discipline him and he will be one of those who always do their homework on time. The best way to do that is to ask him gently, because criticism will get you nowhere with Virgo children. Infact, they will tend to think too much about their mistakes in such cases and may end up getting ill.
    You can give them the smallest of chores and they will carry them out perfectly. A Virgo child is dependable, sincere, adaptable, responsible as well as friendly. Usually he has a very pleasant temperament, unless teased or criticized too much. Then, he may become too cranky for his own good. His characteristics profile includes qualities like honesty and alertness. You will have to teach him how to restrain himself when the teacher passes a wrong statement. Virgos find it extremely different it to accept any fact that has no proof of its validity.
    Your Virgo child will also question the facts written in the books and demand an explanation. He will always have a need of learning more; having less knowledge than others doesn't go well with him. Accepting close a friendship doesn't come easily to a Virgo and if he is teased about it, he will most probably become too conscious to go ahead with it. It's better to be conspicuous even when you get to know about this. In addition to emotional love, he will need physical comforting also.
    He may never show this, but he does need your hugs and kisses. Since a Virgo child tends to be quite shy, modest and humble, he will need the constant reassurance that he is as attractive as the most outgoing children. He likes orderliness and it is better if you do not disturb the way he has kept the things in his cupboard. He is also very fussy about time and you never find him running late for school. With a Virgo, everything has to be perfect. If it is not so, be ready to hear his criticism.
    Nobody can escape his critical eyes and that includes him also. He will always handle his responsibilities well, spend money cautiously and be helpful around the house. A Virgo child usually matures early and will show wisdom far beyond his years. You can spoil him, without the danger of making him too pampered. Encourage him to indulge in his fantasies and imagination; it will help him in attaining that perfect emotional balance. He may demand too much perfection from you, but then, he will always be there when you need him!
