    Pisces is the last sign of the zodiac, which has the symbol of 'The Fish'. Pisces people are not much interested in the material things of life and are not the ones to run after money. It's not that they are against riches, but they are more aware of its impermanence. They are not greedy about anything, least of all wealth. A Piscean has an easy carelessness about tomorrow. Pisces display either of the two basic personalities traits - going with the flow or against it. They will either go where the current takes them or fight against it.
    Only if they choose the latter one, will they be truly happy and satisfied with their life. When they manage to do this, they are sure to reach the highest echelons of success. A Piscean characteristics profile exhibits loads of charm and a very easygoing attitude. He is not bothered by restrictions, as long as he has the right to dream and live his own life. Radical opinions do not stimulate him at all, nor do insults make him agitated. Very few things compel him to lose his temper. When a Pisces does get angry, it is better to stay away.
    He can give the most sarcastic comments, be extremely rude and lash you with a scathing tongue. The best part is that the anger seldom lasts long and he will be his usual placid self again. When he sees the world, his eyes seem to be covered with rose-colored spectacles. Pisceans live in the world of their own, even when they are completely aware of the rough side of humanity. In their world, everyone is good and everything is beautiful. They have a very sharp memory and tend to remember the minutest of details.
    When we give a description of Pisces personality, one of the basic traits that come in mind is its soothing stability. Even in the worst of storms, a Piscean will never panic and will maintain his poise. He has a good intuition and if he tells you not to go out of the house on a particular day, it is better to stay indoors. Pisces is the last sign of the zodiac and represents death and eternity. It has a blend of the qualities of all the other zodiacs. It is because of this fusion that it becomes very difficult to truly understand a Pisces.
    He is a great organizer and pays attention to details (like Virgo), has a fair and detached judgment (like Libra), is sympathetic and moody (like Cancer), displays honesty and kindness (like Sagittarius), loves people and attention (like Leo) and is analytical (like Aquarius). At the same time, he talks very quickly and expertly (like Gemini), is passive and stubborn (like Taurus), can know your deepest secrets (like Scorpio), shows dedication to duty (like Capricorn) and overflows with optimism, innocence and zeal (like Aries).
    A Piscean likes to argue, loves nature and holds fierce ambitions. He is deeply interested in music and art. He has great wisdom and is very compassionate towards the weak. He loves to help people in distress and utilizes most of his energy doing this only. You will never know when a Piscean is profoundly hurt. He hides his deepest emotions behind a veil of humor. The humor may be warm and innocent or cold and ruthless. However, it is sure to be a mask for some other emotion, more often than not.
    Laughter is his best cover and he will use it wisely. He has compassion for the sick and even tries to understand the feelings of the lonely. Even those who are weak by choice will get Pisces shoulder to cry on. He never judges people and accepts them just as they are. He knows all your vices and virtues, understands them and will still be there if you need him. He wants to help everyone; still most of the people fail to understand the sensitivity of the fish. He absorbs the positive as well as the negative vibrations around him.
    The world needs the creativity, imagination and empathy of Pisceans and they know it. Very often, they bury their own dreams to see their loved ones realizing their ambitions. One quality of Pisceans that is very annoying is that they hate to answer questions in a simple 'Yes' or 'No'. Mostly, the answer will be a 'Maybe'. Still, he cares and he lets you know that. He is much stronger and wiser than most of the other people, he only has to realize it. The moment he struggles against the tide, you know he will reach the shore before anyone else.
    """

    There are basically two types of Pisces men - those who go against the tide and those who go where it takes them. The former types remain on the lookout for the right opportunity, struggle against the world to utilize its full potential and triumph over life. The latter types remain tangled in their dreams, may not notice even when the opportunity knocks at the door and may miss the bright sunlight of success. A Piscean man needs to develop the personality traits of resolute judgment and unwavering actions to realize his ambitions and be a winner.
    He also has to bury his old, unrealizable dreams if he wants to move ahead in life. All this doesn't mean that he is weak or feeble. It's just that he lives in his dreams too much and has to will himself to get up and indulge in real action. When he manages to brush off the starry dust from his eyes, he sees the real world and then, goes about doing the business of earning his bread. A Piscean male has a very clever and sharp mind. The moment he starts working towards practical aims, you can be sure that he will win the next 'Achievers Award'.
    The only problem comes in making him look beyond those unrealistic dreams. If your fish knows how to swim against the current, you can be sure that you are luckiest girl on this earth. After we have dealt with the practical aspect of the relationship, lets come to the emotional one. This is something you will never have to worry about, with a Pisces guy. A Piscean man will never ever be short on emotions and romance. Infact, he practically breathes them. If the practical aspect of his characteristics profile is fine, you can be sure you have been rewarded with the best guy in the world.
    He never holds a bias against any person. You will never find him passing a judgment in context of anyone, unless and until he has experienced the same situation in which that person is now. Even then, he will try to understand that person's reasons, rather than criticize him. Accusations don't go down well with him either. A Pisces man is never ever mean. However, at times, he may say something, which turns out to be quite different from what he intended. He is totally dependable and you can trust him with your darkest secrets.
    He is a very good listener and people always come to him to discuss all their major and minor problems. When he is with you, try not to burden him more with your tensions too. Throughout the day, he has been listening to other people's troubles and the way he is, he would have absorbed all those negative energies. Now, when he is with you, he needs to get all of this out of his system and rejuvenate himself. Piscean men have such an empathetic disposition that they need to rest every now and then, to bring back the calmness and steadiness.
    If they want to be left alone, they should not be disturbed. Closeness and togetherness is good, but let them have their moments of solitude. Give them the space they desire and the heart will only grow fonder. A Pisces man is very sensitive and can get hurt very easily. He appears to be confident of himself, but on the inside, he is painfully shy. He needs to know that you appreciate him, care for him and love him. He has a very quick temper, but the anger subsides as quickly as it comes.
    He will never remain angry for a very long time and will seldom hold a grudge. He has the ability to see right through people's outer layer and that makes it very difficult to fool him. On the other hand, he can fool you if he wants and such situations will arise frequently, since he likes to keep his own affairs to himself. A Piscean man may speak a small lie once in a while. This is because he has some secret fear of revealing all about himself. However, you don't need to worry, as these lies will always be completely harmless and help keep his imagination running.
    Jealously is not one of the personality traits of a Pisces male. He trusts you totally, but remember he is also a man and will definitely expect loyalty from you. As far as he is concerned, you will get plenty of reasons to be jealous, as he will have close friends of both the sexes. He will also appreciate beauty, but he will never be disloyal. That's just not him. If you can cope up with this, you will be rewarded with the most romantic husband, with whom you talk about almost everything under the sun.
    A Piscean guy is never too cautious about money and you will have to handle that front. Infact, you need to present yourself as the perfect example of a saver and he will, sooner or later, follow suit. He learns quickly from the people he admires and respect, so what better person than you to teach him economy. With children, he will be a lot of fun and extremely loving. He will listen patiently to their childish problems, provide them with solutions, keep their imagination oiled and minds active. However, teaching them discipline will be your responsibility.
    Remember that a Pisces man is very fond of his dreams. Never ever step on them or laugh at them - he will be hurt. Infact, believe in them and one day, you may be walking on the red carpet besides him. Trust him, give him love and keep him emotionally nourished. In return, he will shower you with lots of love and affection and provide you with a happy and rich home. Don't nag or criticize him and always support him in realizing his hopes. Nurture his imagination and one day, you will find yourself blessed with some incredibly good luck!

    A Pisces female is full of womanly charms and at the very first glance, she will look like the girl every guy falls in love with. She looks totally vulnerable, very different from the modern, liberated girl of today. Almost every guy feels like taking her in his arms and protecting her from the big bad world. She is one of those women who stand behind their husbands and support them in every way they can. A Piscean female will never try to dominate her husband. Rather she will like it if you do the usual gallant gestures, like holding the door for her.
    She wants her man to love her, protect her and take good care of her. She will lean on him completely, showing full confidence in his strength and abilities. This acts like a solid ego boost to almost every male. She will always be a patient listener, with whom you can share all your secret dreams, desires and hopes. She doesn't have a single masculine streak in her and if you are looking for the typical womanly traits, then Pisces girl is the one for you. She is totally feminine, in all the seasons and at all the places.
    She can sit adoringly with you, admiring your each and every quality. The warmth of her personality makes most the men relax in an instant and bask in the glory of their manhood. Enough for the initial falling in and courtship period! Now comes the time of marriage and life after that. A Pisces woman nags just like all the other women and she has a bad temper too. In her fury, she can turn bitterly sarcastic. The consolation here is that she is gentle for more periods, than she is nudging and prodding.
    In fact, majority of the time, she will be yielding, wistful and all womanly. Her scathing tongue will become loose once in a while only. In case you have found the opposite characteristics profile in a Piscean woman, chances are that she suffered extremely harsh treatment at a very young age and the bitterness will be a result of that trauma only. She has certain subtleness around her and may also become a little deceptive at times. She is not mean; it's just that she feels like keeping certain things to herself only.
    Then, the deceptiveness also helps her in keeping you interested in her. A Pisces female is very sentimental and even slightly harsh words can cause her to cry hours at end. You can easily imagine what will happen when you really hurt her feelings. She may imagine herself to totally worthless and incapable of the fighting spirit to survive. Then, you will have to assure her that she is appreciated for her great wisdom, empathy and vast understanding. You know that whatever you are saying is true; it's just a matter of convincing her about the same.
    You will have to remove her doubts about herself or she may become too closeted in self-defence. A Pisces girl is very shy, emotional and vulnerable. To protect her susceptibility, she often wears a cloak of wittiness, frigidity and independence. She is afraid of exposing her true self, lest people hurt her in the process. She is a true romantic and secretly yearns for a person who will love her, cuddle her, hug her and make her feel loved and protected. As a mother she may be too permissive and find it difficult to teach discipline.
    You may have to teach her the fine balance between controlling and pampering. A Piscean female will sacrifice her own dreams to realize the hopes of her children. She may not be good with finances, but will manage to save money if the situation so desires. She will remember the smallest incidents of your life, so you better remember her birthday and your anniversary. She may become dreamy once in a while, but then she will always be there with you, without being asked to. She is someone you will want to take care of, throughout your life!

    Pisces baby lives in a dream world, where there are elves, fairies and magic trees. He is somewhat different from the other babies, he will never shout, scream or throw tantrums for getting things done. He has a better tactic up his sleeve; he will charm you into agreeing for whatever he wants. Even after he grows up, the childish, wistful aspect of his personality will never go away. Make-believe world will always appeal to him. Whenever you are doing something important, just create a small little world around him.
    Use some soft toys, balloons, dolls, etc, to do that and you will never even hear a word from him. A Piscean baby has a very sharp sixth sense and intuition. This particular personality trait may catch you off-balance quite a number of times. You will face a great amount of difficulty to make him adhere to schedules and routines. He will not eat because it is time for dinner or sleep because it is 11:00 pm. He wants to eat when he's hungry, sleep when he's tired and play when something attracts his fancy.
    It will be better if you adjust yourself to his schedule. Infact, your Pisces child will teach you not to be a slave of the clock. For him, it is just a piece of machinery, which should never dictate how you live your life. He is not too confident about his abilities and will have to be reassured time and again. Don't forget to give him lots of attention and admiration. Then, every now and then, he will want to be left alone. It is better to leave him alone in such silent spells and he will come back in some time, though it may turn out be the time for dinner rather than lunch.
    Conventions and patterns do not gel with the characteristics profile of Piscean children and they find it very difficult to stick to them. So, their teachers might find it a little difficult to fit in them in a particular mould. They will hold an interest in various art forms, music, dance and anything that's creative. A Piscean child is quite good with words and may become involved in poetry or story telling. Handling responsibilities will hardly be his cup of tea and you will have to teach him this. The fish is also extremely sensitive and harsh words are enough to being tears in his eyes.
    He will have a deep wisdom and will mostly prefer spending time with adults, rather than kids. People often accuse a March-born kid of lying, but this is not the case. He does not have a malicious bone in his body. It's just that he has his own vision of the world and the realities are too harsh for him to bear. So, he adds his own color and warmth to the situation to make it somewhat bearable. He needs your sympathetic attitude or he may draw into an unspoken, glum depression. What a Piscean baby sees and hears, no other person in the world can even imagine.
    Whenever he starts imagining, encourage him to capture it in the form of paintings, poems or other forms of art. Then, gently goad him to face the brutal realities of life. Slowly, he will learn to accept the world as it is. Don't stifle his fantasies; he needs to see them in order to build up the strength to face the facts of life. After he has refreshed his own soul, he will be able to do the same for others too. You can always learn from his empathy, patience, imagination and calmness. About that silver stars he follows, just wait and it is possible that one day, he brings it home and then, you can wish on it too!

    Pisces, the last sun sign of the zodiac, has Neptune as its ruling planet. The planet of Neptune has been named after the Roman God of Sea and the deep, ocean blue color of the planet perfectly reflects this belief. The planet takes approximately 165 years to complete an entire circle around the sun. This means that it spends, on an average, about 14 years in each sign of the zodiac. Neptune was discovered by astronomers in 1846 and since then been associated with idealism, spirituality, imagination, mysticism, psychic phenomena and empathy.
    On the negative side, it is also identified with illusion, confusion and deception, extreme sensitivity and altered mental states. When the planet of Neptune was not discovered, Jupiter was regarded as the ruling planet of Piscean zodiac. Even today, some astrologers believe Jupiter to be a co-ruler of Pisces sun sign. Neptune passes on the qualities like spiritual development, romance, lyricism, wistfulness, compassion, insight and enhanced sixth sense, to those born under Pisces sun sign.
    The zodiac represents the talent to evolve from the material world to the spiritual world. Neptune rules the feet and is associated with angelica, iris, orchids, violets, water lilies, mosses, ferns, alder, ash, dogwood and fig and seaweed. The major colors related to the planet are silver, sea greens, mauve, purple and violet. The stone that seems to be the closest to Neptune is Amethyst, while the closest metals are germanium and strontium. For those who are born under the Pisces zodiac sign, Thursday is the lucky day and seven, the lucky number.
