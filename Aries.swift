    The moment you come across an Aries, the first thing that comes to your mind is his/her friendly nature. The friendliest person in your neighborhood will most probably be an Aries personality. People having an Aries profile cannot tolerate injustice, always fight against it and will defend the weak. Aries, The Ram, is the first sign of the zodiac, considered to be the infant representing birth. Just like an infant, he is also aware only of himself and his needs. However, he is not selfish. It's just that he is totally ignorant of the fact that his needs may be causing you some inconvenience.
    The innocence of Aries people is enough to cover their, sometimes, aggressive behavior. This naivet√© brings fearlessness, while at the same time making them highly vulnerable. They trust people easily, get hurt in the process, forgive and forget, and then, trust again. An Aries person is beyond shrewdness and fallacy and can never lie, not even to save his life. He is what he seems to be. Qualities like subtlety, diplomacy or modesty just don't gel with Aries symbol. An Aries can be calm, wise and serious, but not before he has gone past youth.
    He is pretty impatient, but liberal with money and material things. Frankness, lack of stability, fear of physical pain, optimism and impulsiveness are some of the basic Aries characteristics. One of the warmest and the most generous zodiac sign, Aries always prefers fame to money. He may get extremely angry in a minute, but the anger seldom lasts for a long time. Aries people never nurse a grudge and completely forgive and forget. They will never let you know that they are hurt.
    They are never shy of apologizing, but they will be hurt if you remember the harsh words they said in anger, but didn't mean. Gossip does not interest an Aries and for him, people are either black or white, without any shades of grey. There is one thing an Aries can never fall short of, conversation. He can speak about anything & everything under the sun. He lives in the present and is a realist, yet believes in miracles. Aries chase success, not waiting for it to fall in their lap, and don't accept defeat. Failure can never keep them down.
    Most of the Aries people are involved in business or creative arts or are involved in planning and organization. If an Aries does something for you, don't forget to express your gratitude. Otherwise, he will be deeply hurt. However, that would not stop him from helping again. Aries usually stick to their opinion and won't listen to anything they do not believe. They have a contemplative side to their personality. The simplicity is blended with the blind passion of a born crusader. Aries is mentally strong and always one of the pioneers.

    An Aries man is full of surprises and excitement and hates monotony and dullness in life. Romance with him will be like a roller coaster ride, where you will not get even a single moment to think and brood. However, it's better not to expect him to understand that you need some security every now and then. Consistency is something that does not gel well with his characteristics profile. The love of an Aries male will warm you with passion one minute and the very next minute, you may feel as if you are sitting in the North Pole.
    Don't ever be rude to him, he will be very hurt and will turn into the coldest person on this earth. You will have to start from the scratch again, to get back the comfort level you once shared. He is highly energetic and always full of creative ideas. You will have to keep up with his energy levels. This is bound to make you tired in the process, at least mentally. An Aries guy will always remain young at heart, even when he gets 90 years old. Slow moves make him impatient. He is one of those who always move ahead of others, boldly and confidently.
    He is generous in the matters of time and money. Full of compassion, he always tries to cheer the people around him. However, just like a baby, he can get very irritated, inconsiderate and difficult when his needs are not met or get delayed for too long. Negativity annoys him. When an Aries male falls in love, he becomes extremely dedicated towards it. If the commitment fails to develop into a successful relationship, he will try his best to salvage it and make it work again. Still, if it breaks up, he will brood over it for sometime.
    Then, the sun will again shine for him and he will fall in love again, with the same fierce devotion and loyalty. An Aries man believes in true love and will constantly be in search of it, though it may require mending his heart numerous times in the process. He will be very passionate in love and you will never get a chance to complain about the lack of romance. Right from poetry to candlelight dinners, you will be treated to anything and everything. He is not the one to hold back anything, especially in love.
    It is advisable that you don't hold back your emotions too. An Aries guy is very expressive and will expect the same from you. Remember to show that you love him and care for him. You must also learn to behave like the heroine in novels and storybooks. When in love, he is very faithful and way too honest and idealistic to fool you. He was not born to indulge in things like promiscuity or even harmless flirtations. However, if you are not able to cope up with his constant need for enthusiasm and romance, he may try to look somewhere else.
    An Aries man will never start another affair behind your back. He is one of those who first end old relationships and then move on to the next one. Even before something like this happens, he will let you know that things are not going as smooth as they were. He will try to make things work. Still, if situations don't improve or you do not do anything to improve them, he will decide to move on. The key to lasting love is always in your hands. Keep the romance alive and he will never even look at the hottest babe in the block.
    If you are trying to get an Aries male interested in you, play hard to get. He loves challenges and will soon be running after you. Don't make the first move or you will lose him forever. He likes to lead in case of love also. However, do not try the jealousy invoking tricks shown in the movies. Forget actual flirting, even a teasing look at another man will make him go thousand miles away from you. He is extremely possessive and exceedingly jealous. An Aries man will want to be your first consideration and cannot tolerate being sidelined for anyone else. He wants you to trust him blindly, but he won't do the same for you.
    He wants his freedom and doesn't like being tied down. That's the way he is, love him or hate him. He is extremely loyal, caring, loving, kind and affectionate. There are some Aries men who appear to be very quiet, but inside, they are as lively and full of beans as any other male of this zodiac. Just give them some time and they will soon be their usual Aries self. Aries man is rebellious at heart and loves to go against the conventions. He needs to learn virtues like humility and modesty.
    The learning process may hurt him and then, he would rush to you to be reassured. Remember to build his bruised ego once again or he will be very hurt. If you want to be with him forever, learn to manage his damaged confidence and show total belief in him. Never ever take the side of someone who is against him, even when he is wrong. You have to love what he loves and hate what he hates. For an Aries man, this is what true love and devotion means. He will give all this to you and expect the same in return.
    If he is angry with you, there is no reason to worry for any damage to your relationship. It is his passivity you need to be afraid of. His anger may result in some very harsh and rude words, but it won't last long. He will usually be the first one to say sorry after a fight and will expect you to forgive and forget. You should know that he never meant what he said in anger. An Aries man will always be there for you, to take care of you. However, he will never curb your freedom. He is the one who would dominate the house and won't tolerate constant nagging. But then, he is the guy who will romance with you even on your 75th anniversary!

    Romance is something that no Aries can live without and the same goes for an Aries woman also. However, for her, not getting on without romance is not same as not being able to live without a man. In her heart, she will always be yearning for that someone special, thinking about him in the monsoon and that will be her idea of romance. She doesn't need a real man for it. Aries female is the one who will do anything and everything herself, without needing any male help. One of her basic personality traits is total confidence in her abilities.
    She has to lead, to be the first one to do anything. At times, her independence does not go well with the male ego. However, an Aries girl never wants a puppy for a lover or a husband. She seeks a man, but not the one who constantly chases her. The best way to woo her is to throw subtle hints, be a little detached and keep her wondering. Give her the impression that you can resist her charms and she will come rushing to you, to prove that she's desirable. Aries women will never have to yearn for male attention.
    They always get plenty of it, but inside they will be waiting for the one they cannot have. An Aries woman can survive even the toughest of circumstances alone and has the ability to come back even after the most gruesome tragedies. She can play the role of a female perfectly and, at the same time, can do everything that a man can do. If you have managed to subdue her aggressive drive, you will be treated to a woman who is full of optimism and has such faith in future that can uplift your mood also.
    An Aries female does not like flattery. You should be sincere while complimenting her. Over-sweetness and too much closeness can make her run away, but she doesn't want you to be too detached also. You'll have to maintain that delicate balance and still keep the romance alive. Once she has committed to you, she will be extremely sentimental and very loyal. Don't dominate an Aries female and don't let her dominate you. Either of the extremes, she will not be able to tolerate. Give her reasons to be proud of you, but do not forget to praise her for her talent too. Her expectations are too high, but she will also give you double in return.
    She is very possessive and love is something she can never share. She can be very jealous even at the slightest of suspicion. In case you have a female secretary, it is better to bid her good bye right now. If an Aries girl gets hurt, she will become as cold as the ice in your fridge and this behavior may last an entire lifetime. She is generous to the faults of her loved ones and it is better not to criticize them in front of her. On the other hand, if you are good to her, she will be extremely kind, tender, loyal and supportive.
    You will get plenty of reasons to be jealous when you are with an Aries female, since she is more comfortable with men than women. However, don't be suspicious of her, she would be really hurt. She is possessive, but she doesn't like to be possessed. She wants her freedom and your complete trust. Remember, if she's committed to you, you have no reasons to doubt her loyalty and sincerity. An Aries woman is much too truthful to be involved with two people at the same time. She will first break up the relationship that is not working.
    She is extremely passionate and believes in forever-lasting relationships. Though, this leaves her disillusioned many a times. She will never play games with you and is incapable of deceit. An Aries girl is nothing if not simple, innocent and very emotional. Maximum chances are that she will continue her career even after marriage. She loves challenges and believes in miracles. Though it sounds a little freaky, but miracles do happen in her case. Just like a typical Aries, she never learns from her mistakes and is likely to fall in the same hole again.
    For her love means sharing and that means sharing everything, right from her emotions and checkbook to your bank account. Always respect an Aries woman and never try to dampen her zeal, or she will be hurt. Though she tries to show that she is very strong, she is as innocent and as vulnerable as a baby. Be there to comfort her when she runs up to you after being disappointed with the world. If you stand up to her when she comes to you like this, you will never ever lose her. An Aries female will never forgive you if you fail to fight for her.
    In return, she will always be there with you, even if she has to go against the whole world. She is not the one to feign illness, but if she is really ill, be there to care for her. She is quite extravagant and giving her the debit cards will mean an empty bank account. She will be a caring mother, who makes no unnecessary fuss and sparks children's imagination. An Aries girl has a bad temper, but it will go away as quickly as it came and leave no grudges behind. She is a complete woman, who gets hurt easily and is totally innocent. Though she is a little impulsive and bossy, she will give you complete security, fight against the world for you and be yours forever!

    Aries child has to have all your attention at any cost. As far as he is concerned, he is the boss and you have no right to ignore him. As he starts growing, his attention gaining tactics become more and more refined. From just wailing and crying, he will come to banging the table with his kiddie spoon, when you don't listen to him. Subtlety is not one of the personality traits of Aries children. They will shout at the top of their voice to let you know what exactly do they want. This trait will be there in both the male as well as the female Aries child.
    He is quite eager about everything, right from walking to talking. He will probably start doing both much before the other children. If you want him to learn discipline, it is better to start teaching him the moment you get discharged from the hospital. He is not the one to learn from his mistakes, so better keep all the sockets in your house covered and all the knives out of his reach. An Aries baby is very affectionate and this feeling will be demonstrated quite often. He will give you a warm bear hug every now and then and kiss you good night everyday.
    Showing authority will make him stubborn. Show him respect if you want him to understand something. He has a quick temper, but it seldom lasts long. After he has cooled down, he will be his usual cheerful self again. Aries child is not at all selfish and will easily share his most favorite toys with everyone. However, make sure that the other children are not nasty to him. Otherwise, the generosity will come to an end and it will be time for fireworks. If you want him to do anything, don't give him comparisons; just challenge him.
    He will do the work even before you have the time to repeat it again. Once an Aries child learns something, he will remember it throughout his life. He is very creative and has a vivid imagination. He will dream the most impossible dreams, but will be ground to reality. A bit confusing, isn't it? Practicality mixed with dreams! However, this is what an Aries baby is - an odd combination of contradictory things. He has to be the first one to do anything and will always want to lead.
    Beneath the tough outer shell of an Aries child is his soft heart, which is vulnerable. He is scared of being unloved and needs a constant reassurance from you. Many a times, he will rush into your arms after being hurt by the real world. Hug him tightly and mend his broken heart. Otherwise, he will get completely shattered. Miracles, fairy godmothers, Santa Claus and angels are something in which all the Aries children believe. However, don't be the one to tell them that they are wrong.
    An Aries child is impatient and you may have to hide that surprise birthday gift in the bank locker. He is not too good with finances, but he will give his last dollar to the handicapped man in old age home. He cannot tolerate injustice or call a wrong person right. Giving him orders won't get anything done. It's better to ask him the same with a smile; he will go running to do your chore. An Aries child loves his freedom; so don't expect him to part with it. He is very optimistic; negative and distressing thoughts can really hurt him deeply.
    Being responsible is not one of the qualities of an Aries child's characteristics profile. You will have to teach him that, through logic and affection. Praise makes him do the correct things more often. If you want him to be out of trouble, make sure that he is not sitting idle. 'An empty mind is devil's workshop' suits perfectly in case of an Aries baby. At the same time, ensure that he gets enough rest to replenish his energy. Love him, nurture him and lead him gently and an Aries child will dream the impossible dreams and make them come true also!

    The zodiac sign of Aries is dominated by the ruling planet of Mars. Earlier the planet of Scorpio sun sign, Mars has been named after the Roman God of War who was said to be daring and totally fearless. The same quality can be found in the personality of an Aries individual. He is just like a child, who does not fear anything or anybody. The ruling planet of Mars provides an Aries individual with the endless supply of strength, vigor, vivacity and endurance. It instills in him the quality of coming straight to the point, rather than dilly-dallying.
    The planet is identified with traits like standing up for what is wrong and fighting for what is right. A Mars individual is always one of the pioneers, the initiators. He is always determined to move ahead in right, irrespective of how much and how potent the obstacles in the way are. The ruling planet of Mars makes him completely sure of his abilities and instills in him guts, a sense of adventure as well as a strength of purpose. He may, at times, act without giving much thought to the consequences of the actions taken.
    The planet also imparts mental strength, liveliness and the resolve to succeed. Such individuals move ahead in life without fear and full of drive, determination and fortitude. The courage sometimes makes them blind to the dangers ahead, which may catch them unawares and throw them off balance. However, the drive to move ahead and achieve the goal is so strong that such a setback manages to stop them only temporarily. Then, they again move ahead with the same fierce determination.
    Mars ruled people also show a preference for sports, adventure and travel. They are quite honest and dependable and show an aptitude for mechanical skills. On the negative front, Mars may instill in them impatience, brutality, arrogance, impulsiveness, jealousy and a propensity to indulge in futile and wasted battle. The planet does not instill a foresight in the individuals and for that, they have to take outside help.
    Items linked with Mars are honeysuckle, geranium, holly, pine, rhubarb, pineapple, woodpecker, eagle, tiger and shark. The planet seems to be very closely associated with the metal iron. Jasper and Rubies are the preferred gems for the individuals born under the influence of Mars. Their lucky day will most probably be Tuesday. The bold and angry colors, like blood red, are the colors considered as lucky for them.
