    Cancer zodiac sign has the symbol of 'The Crab'. One of the basic characteristics of a Cancerian is that he is very prone to mood swings, which are matched by changing emotions. At one point of time, you may have seen him in a typical party mood, enjoying himself and laughing at other people's jokes. He may come across as the most extroverted member in the entire group. However, another time, he may be completely introverted, sitting in a corner and lost in his own world. This single personality trait can help you in identifying a Cancer very easily.
    A Cancerian will never run behind fame and publicity, but if he ever gets it, he definitely knows how to bask in the limelight. In a melancholic mood, he can become the coldest person on this earth and drown you in his bottomless depression. Cancerians are prone to pessimism and usually hide their fears behind a veil of humor. They love to dream and for them, sky's the limit. When he cries, it is because he is deeply hurt from inside. A harsh glance or a rough tone can easily break Cancer's vulnerable heart.
    When he is hurt, he will either cry his heart out or retreat into a silent spell. However, it is rare that he takes revenge from the one who has hurt him. If a Cancer retreats to his shell, you can be sure he will become completely unreachable. He won't pick his phone, answer the doorbell or even check his mail. Another mood that can engulf a Cancer is a snappy one, or you can say a crabby one. He will hate the world and snap at anything and everything. However, you can be sure he is not angry with you and will soon be his normal self again.
    While in a conversation, the facial features of a crab will change a number of times, displaying his numerous moods. He has a vivid imagination and at times will drown you in his moods too. Each and every experience affects him and gets engraved in his memory. Cancerians remember everything life has taught them and are true patriots. Past intrigues them and they love to collect antiques, old treasures and ancient relics. They are the perfect keepers of secrets and people automatically confide in them.
    However, their own thoughts and secrets are strictly off limits for everyone. A typical cancer will never discuss his personal life with anyone. Compassion and intuition gel perfectly with the Cancer profile. He seldom judges people, just soaks up what comes his way and reflects the same. He will never ever give up an object he cherishes, be it a gift from a lover or the worn jeans he loves wearing. Cancerians have a soft heart; they care about people and are quite helpful. However, they wait to see if someone else is helping.
    If the answer is yes, they will sit back and let the other person be the savior. In case no one comes forward; they will be there to rescue you. A Cancer person may come at the last minute, but he will save you just before you are about to drown. He is not selfish, it just that he never wants to be impulsive. But, he will save you nonetheless. Before he makes any move, a Cancerian must be sure of strong backing. Without it, he hates to venture on his own. He does not forget mistakes easily, especially his own.
    He will brood over them and take a long time before moving ahead again. Cancerian loves, rather reveres, his home and his loved ones. Too much is not even enough for him. He needs more, more security, more love and more care. Insecurity may lead him to depression and weaken him physically. However, Cancerians have this amazing quality of self-healing. All they require is happiness, optimism and laughter in large doses. They are prone to negative thoughts and are always preparing for the unseen future.
    The maxim 'Old is Gold' fits perfectly to a Cancer, whether it is the case of people or things. He is also very good at making as well as managing wealth. He has a large heart and will share willingly if his loved ones are in need. However, wastage, especially of food, is sure to tick him off. All the sensitivity of a crab is hidden beneath his hard shell and it will take much care and love to bring him out of his shell and close to you!
    """
    public static let man: String = """
    A Cancer man will come across as an extremely shy person, who speaks less and minds his own business. He is not one of those who tell everything about themselves in the first meeting itself. Infact, it will take a large number of meetings to get even a little close to him. Cancerian male may seem to a different person every time you meet him. He may be nervous and fickle one moment; extremely confident the second minute and too shy the very next. His frown can easily turn, first, into smile and then, into a laugh.
    A Cancerian guy may get sad and melancholic at times and then, you will feel like putting your arms around him and comforting him. Then, suddenly his wistfulness will vanish and he will be sparkling with wit and humor. He is a true romantic and sees fairytale dreams frequently. However, he is as close to reality as anyone can be. Baffled? Don't worry, it will take some time, but you will start understanding your Cancerian man slowly and gradually. The changes in him do not mean a changing personality like the Geminis.
    It is just a change of moods and he will soon be his usual self again. The basic characteristics profile will, however, remain the same. Just like a crab, he retreats into a shell when his emotions are hurt. The shell is his haven and he will remain there till he is ready to face the world again. Cancerian men may look harsh and distant at times, but inside they are very gentle, kind and affectionate. Rudeness is not one of their personality traits. It just acts a cover to hide their true, vulnerable feelings.
    A Cancer man needs to feel secured of your love every now and then, so don't forget to say 'I Love You' everyday. The same goes for money too, debt makes him uneasy. He is the one who always pays his bills on time and he likes saving more than spending. He is not stingy, but he is also not extravagant. However, a Cancerian male won't sacrifice his taste and style in the name of economy. Economy for him means getting the worth of money he spent. Quality plays the utmost importance as far as he is concerned.
    A Cancer guy is very conscious of his looks, his house, his car and everything that surrounds him. His clothes need to have that perfect cut, his car that perfect shine and his food that perfect taste. He is not one of those wild men who like going against the usual norms, and sophistication is something he can't live without. There is another thing a Cancer male cannot live without - talking about his Mommy Dearest! She is most likely to be there in his every second conversation.
    In the other extreme, he will be totally detached from her. However, his relationship with his mother will never be casual and moderate. It has to be either of the two extremes and the first one is the most likely. At the same time, he will be the most important person in his mother's life. Make sure you pamper him as much and give him as much attention as his mother. Chivalry is in his nature, unless you give him reasons to be otherwise. A Cancerian guy may take sometime to judge you as his probable soul mate.
    However, once he is sure, he will shower you with love, care, admiration and gifts. At the same time, you will be expected to meet his standards, which may be quite high. If he has decided you are the one he wants to live his life with, he will pursue you with fierce determination and make you fall in love with him. Now, we talk about the qualities of a Cancerian guy as a father. He will be totally proud of his son and fiercely protective of his daughter. He will be extremely patient with them. With a Cancerian man, there is one thing you and the kids will never be short of - Love!

    Have you met a Cancerian woman recently? Are you a little confused as to what she really is - chirpy, somber or distant? She is all of these and still, she is none of these. Even more confused? A Cancerian woman has mood swings every now and then and these are only a few of her mood swings. However, her basic personality traits remain the same. She is very sensitive, emotional, kind and caring. Now's the catch! Most of her traits will be hidden behind a shell of indifference and aloofness, breaking which will require quite a lot of effort.
    You will have to gently coerce a Cancerian girl to get out of her shell and come into the big bad world without it. The best time to do this is in the moonlight, when there are maximum chances of catching her in her true emotions. When in love, she will be tender, womanly, timid and modest. She dislikes criticisms, can't stand rejection and gets deeply hurt by harsh words. Too much aggressiveness on your part may make her a little hesitant. She loves her mother, so you better learn to love as well as respect her too.
    A Cancer woman will never make the first moves in a relationship; she only knows how to move backwards or sideways. This is because of two reasons, her shyness and her fear of being rejected. This female has some secrets and she won't like you prying around her personal diary. She is very insecure and will need your constant reassurance. It doesn't matter if she is the current 'Miss Universe' or has men drooling over her all the time, it is your attention and appreciation she would be the most concerned about.
    You will have to learn to live with a Cancerian woman's mood swings, which is not so difficult since she is so good in every other way. She is extremely loyal and will keep you happy with her warm and rich humor. Once she is committed to you, she will remain yours forever and ever. Adultery is not one of her traits. With a Cancerian woman, you will always have to be careful with words. She is very sentimental and can get hurt very easily. Then, she can cry like a 2-year old baby and you will be expected to console her and wipe her tears.
    A Cancer female is a great cook and makes better food than a 5-star hotel chef. She is quite careful with money as well. Neither will she be stingy, nor totally extravagant. She has a habit of saving everything that is usable, be it money, old buttons or empty jars. She also saves things that have a sentimental value attached to them, like the sweater grandmother knitted on her fifth birthday. A Cancer female fiercely guards what is hers and that includes you too! However, she is not too possessive or jealous. But, she does not like sharing her love too.
    She is one of those people who do not crib about bad luck. She will get depressed and may shed a few tears alone, but she will be patient and wait for the time to change again, this time in her favor. Almost all the Cancerians have the desire of being pampered like a child, especially when they feel low. Don't forget to pay your Cancer girl extra attention when she is depressed, otherwise she may retreat deeper into her shell. And then, it will be very difficult to bring her back to her normal self.
    She will want to be told time and again that she is still desirable and you still need her. However, she is not weak and is completely capable of looking after herself. In fact, she is one of those who sacrifice all that they have, for their loved ones. She just needs some spoiling after every few days. A Cancerian woman may be fragile as far as her feelings are concerned, but when you need her, she will be as strong as the 'Rock of Gibraltar'. She will also be very protective of her children and make them feel completely secure.
    Kids will be the center of her universe and she will pamper them with her love, affection and care. The children will also be very close to her and no matter how much far they go from home, they will come back to her and she will know this. A Cancer female always needs you, but she will never get too aggressive. She knows that you may leave for a while, to follow your dreams, but in the end, she is the one you will come back to. Then, you will find her as charming as before, waiting for you with freshly baked bread and hot soup. She will feed you, listen to your worries and make you smile again! Need anything more?

    Are you the proud parent of a Cancerian child? If yes, then it's better to be get used to his extreme mood swings. At times, his moods change with the changing hours. A Cancer child is very observant and whatever he sees, will remain etched in his memory forever. He is very emotional and lives in a world of his own, which may make him lonely at times. His face will always reflect myriad of emotions, some of which you will not be able to understand also. Home environment deeply affects a Cancerian baby.
    He wants lots of emotional nurturing from his family. Infact, his personality will be very much influenced by the reactions of his family members to his traits. He is extremely shy to ask for your attention and love, so be sure to give him plenty without of hugs waiting for him to ask. Disapproval will hurt him deeply. In the initial years of their life, Cancer children are quite easy to manage as well as discipline. However, in adolescence, their characteristics profile may show a little bit of rebellion.
    They have a vivid imagination and can keep themselves busy with imaginary people and things. Don't stop a Cancerian child from letting his imagination run loose. It is one of his ways of getting over the wounds given by others. He is quite emotional, but he is also very independent and will hardly be one of the followers. If you ignore a Cancer baby for too long or say harsh words to him, he may go into the gloomy spell. Then, he will turn into a crybaby, who will keep to himself and find it difficult to form friendships and get close to people.
    Never ever make the mistake of ignoring the sensitivity of a Cancerian child; it may hamper his emotional development. It is better to help him get over his numerous fears, with your love and care. Otherwise, he may turn into a snappy, brooding and bitter individual. The opposite can make him a tolerant, kind, self-assured and caring adult. Rain will make a Cancerian nostalgic and he might suddenly become a poet. However, thunder may frighten him. He is very creative and will need your appreciation to develop his potential in this field.
    You will have to make him feel secure and loved every now an then, or else he may imagine that you are apathetic towards him. However, don't give in to his each and every demand, else he may become extremely pampered and spoilt. Do give him a healthy spanking when he really needs it. As Cancer children grow older, they realize that world is not what they thought it to be. People are not like Mom and Dad at all, infact they are entirely opposite.
    They realize that no one can care like the family and will become extremely devoted towards it. The creativity of a Cancer child may result in a trifle fight being described as a life or death situation. However, when a Cancer child is really hurt, he will most probably keep quiet and brood within. Even the slightest of teasing can make him feel miserable and force him to go deep inside that protective shell, which no one can pierce.
    He is not the one to use his pocket money on useless things and then, demand more money. Infact, he will try to earn his own money by doing odd jobs, like babysitting, cutting the neighbor's grass, etc. Cancerian child will always try to help people and will be kind towards animals too. He is always full of humor and has a contagious laugh. He may leave the home at a very tender age, but remember he will come back soon. After all, he still needs the love and care of his Mommy and Daddy!

However, it can be understood and thus, controlled, to quite an extent. Individuals who have the Moon as their ruling planet tend to have a very vivid as well as colorful imagination, which at times borders on the fantasies or may lead to excessive worry and even hysteria. The moods of a June-born tend to vary a lot, at times to extremes, making him highly unpredictable.
    Moon symbolizes the soul, the unconscious self of an individual. It is believed to be associated with femininity, fertility, emotions, maternity, family bonds, sensitivity, memory, death and decay. The ruling planet of Cancer tends to move through the entire Zodiac, with such a speed that astrologers believe it to influence other signs too. The orbital plane of the Moon, known as the ecliptic, has a cycle of 13-1/2 days. The position of the planet at the time of birth of an individual is said to have a major influence on his personality.

Those born during the waning period of the moon tend to be older and more thoughtful. Moon displays the power of internal light and signifies the nature of an individual as seen by the others. It has an influence on his feelings, his manner of handling the relationships and also his response to different circumstances.
