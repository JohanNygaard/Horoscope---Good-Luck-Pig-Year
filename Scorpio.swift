    Scorpio, with the symbol of 'The Scorpion', is one of the three water signs of the zodiac. One of the first things that you notice about Scorpios are their eyes; they will be very intense and totally hypnotic. Infact, many people find it very difficult to stand steady under a Scorpio's constant gaze. His eyes seem to be penetrating your soul, knowing your deepest secrets and desires. The truth is, more often than not, they are. Scorpios have a big ego. They know what they are and what they are not. It doesn't matter what you think about them.
    They are immune to both comments as well as compliments, because they know whether they are right or wrong. A Scorpio has perfect control over his emotions and he always retains his faultless poise. You will hardly see his emotions being reflected on his face, whether it's a blush or a flush. Infact, Scorpios deliberately practice a vacant look. The same goes for their body posture also, you will hardly see them pacing around in nervousness. However, behind this impeccable composure is their torrid inner nature.
    However, they will always try to probe you, your nature and your motives. Fierce determination is a typical Scorpio personality trait. He has a strong willpower and is not the one to accept defeat easily. The characteristic profile of a Scorpio also tells us that he is honest, to the point of hurting someone. If you have asked for his opinion, you will get the brutal truth, without any sugar coating. He never gives false compliments and does not know how to flatter. However, if he does say something nice to you, be sure that it is truly sincere and is coming straight from the heart.
    If you ask a Scorpio for a favor, it will be either a simple 'Yes' or 'No', not something like 'I will try'. If he really likes you, he will go out of the way to help you. You never have neutral feelings for a Scorpio; you will either be amongst his dedicated admirers or malicious enemies. However, no one challenges him openly, not even the most spiteful enemy. Scorpios have this lingering charm around them and are extremely sympathetic towards the sick or miserable. They are fearless and can stand anything from physical pain to poverty.
    They have complete confidence in themselves and know that they shall pass through this also. A Scorpio is extremely loyal and will go to the length of laying down his life for his loved ones. He has an exceptionally good memory. He never forgets an act of benevolence and always remembers to repay it. Similarly, a Scorpio also remembers any pain caused to him, though the reaction may differ. An eagle will crush the enemy; a scorpion will meticulously plan and demolish the enemy, while the lizard will keep it inside him for years and may harm himself in the process.
    Scorpio loves to play with danger. At the same time, he is interested in religion and curious about all the aspects of life as well as death. If you are close to him, you will feel extremely protected and cared for. He is also fiercely possessive of what he believes to be his. If a Scorpio really wants to do something, it will never remain a dream forever. He will find one or the other way to get what he wants. He is very passionate about everything around, even his home. However, beneath his tough exterior is a gentle heart that knows how to love and care.

    When you talk about a Scorpio, one of the basic personality traits that come to your mind is passion. The same goes for a Scorpio man too. He is intensely passionate about everything around him, including love. If you look at the surface, he will look totally calm and composed. Just look beneath that outer layer of his and you will find his smoldering passion. In case you are scared of getting burnt, better put your jogging shoes and run away. Don't mess with a Scorpio man unless and until you are sure that this is the man you want.
    If you manage to go close to him, you will be rewarded with a warm fire that will ensure you are never left cold again. Once you have glanced into the piercing, hypnotic eyes of a Scorpio male, you will never again be totally neutral towards him. His characteristics profile is an odd mix of intellect, philosophy, emotions and passion. He loves luxury and tends to indulge in excesses, in case of food, drinks and love. So, you saw that - love! Yes, it's true. Scorpio men are the most passionate about love and romance.
    They never get caught in it unawares. They know about it since the time they learned how to talk. Even the most innocent looking Scorpio man will always be filled with passion inside. Never ever arouse his temper. A furious Scorpio man can give you lifetime-lasting scars, especially when he is hurt. He has to win in each and every aspect of life and failure breaks something inside him. Yet, he will display perfect sportsmanship and never even let you that defeat has bothered him.
    Most probably, a Scorpio guy will keep a girl tortured before proposing her. If you are involved with such a man, better ensure that your reputation is spotless. He will never ever go in for a girl who is ludicrous or shameless. Gossip seldom interests him and he is hardly bothered by other people's opinions. He knows what he is and what they say or think will hardly make a difference. Forget strangers, even the views of his friends or relatives do not matter. He is one of those who will marry you even if the entire world is against you.
    Once he has become close to you and formed an opinion about you, no one in the world can sway him. Honesty, sincerity, guts and reliability are ingrained in a Scorpio male. He never indulges in self-pity and envying someone is beyond him. Who could be better than a Scorpio? If you want to get involved with a Scorpio guy, better have some courage in yourself too. If you are planning on enticing him with that feminine mystery, it's definite that he will get attracted towards you. Then, prepare yourself to be ripped off that mystery.
    He loves to solve mystery and you will be probed deeper and deeper till all the secrets have come out. He is very choosy with friends, so you can imagine what he will do in case of a lover. It will be like going through an X-ray machine. Once he has made up his mind that you are the one, he will drown you in his passion. He is combination of a caveman and a sophisticated prince. One thing that you will have to get used to, with a Scorpio man is that he will never display his emotions in public. Infact, he may even make fun of you in front of everyone.
    You will be fuming, right? This was expected. But, when you are alone, he will whisper such sweet nothings in your ear that you will fall in love with him again. If you have some doubts about your looks, don't ask him. He will give his honest opinion. He will never say you are looking like a princess, when you are looking like a slob. Yet, when he gives you a compliment, you can be sure it's coming from the heart. If he says, "You are looking like Miss Universe", just rush and fill the form for that beauty pageant before the deadline runs out.
    Scorpio men are jealous and possessive to the extreme. Don't even think of teasing him with another man. He will erupt like a volcano and your male friend may end up in the hospital. On the other hand, you may get plenty of reasons to be jealous. There is hardly any person on this earth who can resist the magnetic personality of a Scorpio. Always remember that the term loyalty is synonymous with Scorpio and how much he charms the other women, he will remain dedicated to you.
    As a father, Scorpio man will demand discipline, respect for elders and independence from his children. You may have to teach him how to display his emotions and be tender towards them. In this case also, act with tact and diplomacy. Never try to dictate him about how he should behave with his children. After reading this, are you wondering whether you should think about the whole relationship again. Take my word, nobody can resist a Scorpio male and you are also one such person.
    Once he has made up his mind that you are the one for him, he will charm you out of your senses. You will be hypnotized by his captivating and intense gaze and won't get the time to escape. If you have the courage and patience, his touch will be as cool as ice and his passion as hot as molten lava. He will take you along with him and you will see the world like never before. If you manage to understand him, he will become the most kind, considerate, loving and selfless man in this world. You will have a husband most women only dream about!

    The beauty of a Scorpio woman is exceptional, mysterious and totally magnetic. She knows that and is proud of herself. She will control her wish to dominate and will let a man lead in a relationship, atleast during courtship. She knows how to hypnotize a man and gets successful, more often than not. Don't expect a Scorpio female to rush into your arms in front of a thousand people and shout her feelings at the top of her voice. Instead, she will come close to you, glance at you in a sensual way and whisper the most romantic words in a seductive tone.
    If you are not sincere with your feelings, don't even try to get close to a Scorpio girl. With those beautiful, penetrating eyes of hers, she can read exactly what is on your mind. She can easily make out your real intentions, so Don't Flirt. It will amount to insulting her and I assure you, insulting her is not at all good for your health. Even when her tone is soothing, her disposition kind and her smile generous, she can be planning the most powerful retaliation. When a Scorpio woman is insulted or gets hurt, her fury knows no bounds.
    Then, she can become the most hard-hearted and most sarcastic person on this earth. If she loves with fierce devotion, she hates with devastating malice. If you are really in love with her, then you need to know more about her. She has a very hypnotic gaze and the moment her eyes meet your, you will go tumbling down in her deep passion. Being noticed by a Scorpio female definitely gives a boost to a man's ego. She needs a man who is stronger than she is and weakness in him won't get her sympathy at all.
    He will be expected to behave like a real man, who can dominate her and make her proud. At the same time, he should respect her individuality. He should be better looking than average, with an intellect, philosophical and totally masculine. He must also be ambitious and able to handle tough situation with poise. After she gets committed, a Scorpio female will shower you with all her love and attention. Her whole life will start revolving around you and she will be extremely loyal and exceedingly passionate.
    She is passionate with everything that is related to her. It is almost impossible for her to have neutral feelings. Either she will deeply cherish or fiercely hate. If any of the feelings are not experienced, she will become completely indifferent towards it. Scorpio women, however, never let these feelings show. Her expression will always remain neutral, betraying nothing. Her anger is very bad and it's better to get out of her way when it gets out of hand. Her characteristics profile will make her storehouse of secrets, but people wouldn't know any of hers.
    Her personal life will be out of bounds for everyone. At the same time, she will never tell the secrets that have been confided in her, not even to you. Even with you, she will have a private part and its better not to pry. That does not mean she is dishonest. Infact, she will be so brutally honest that, at times, she may hurt people in the process. Like a typical Scorpio, she will choose her friends very carefully and the credible ones will remain with her throughout her life. She will never maintain a relationship with unworthy people.
    Determination and will power are her basic personality traits. She can use them anytime to come out of anything that is negative. If you have been able to win the true love of a Scorpio female, you can be sure you will never feel lonely again. She will be totally devoted to you and even if you two don't get married for any reasons beyond your control, her love for you will not change. She is one of those who believe in the phrase 'Till Death Do Us Apart'. Rather than overshadowing her husband, she believes in supporting him.
    'Behind every successful man, there is a woman'; this idiom is perfect in case of the husband who has a Scorpio wife. For her, the future, the happiness and the dreams of her husband hold the supreme importance. She will always defend him fiercely in public and won't take nicely to anyone taking advantage of him. She will always encourage him to reach for the stars, build his courage and never let him turn back from midway. Scorpio women love their homes and keep them spic and span.
    Now comes the dangerous part. A Scorpio girl is extremely jealous and fiercely possessive of her loved ones. She is prone to suspicions; so don't give reasons to be doubtful of you. On the other hand, you will have to control your jealousy, since she will be attracting a lot of members of the opposite sex. She also dislikes being possessed by anyone, including you. In such a scenario, just remember that a Scorpio woman will always be loyal and devoted to you, even in the worst of circumstances.
    And then, you know you cannot leave her and it is better to adjust to such a trifle thing. Nobody walks away from a Scorpio, right? As far as money is concerned, she will enjoy it whether she saves it in a piggy bank or splurges it on luxurious things. She is very conscious of her social standards and will never compromise in case of status. She likes power and will sacrifice money and many other things for it. She seems to be very practical, but inside she is very emotional. Like all Scorpios, she will not see any viewpoint in case of her own emotions.
    A Scorpio female has a sense of fairness and justice. If you don't wish her good morning one day after a fight, she will do the same for the next four days. The same goes for generosity also. If you do one kind deed for her, she will do four in return. As a mother, she will extremely possessive of her children and will care for them. However, she may not express her love openly and this is something you will have to teach her. She will make them independent, fair, strong and proud of themselves, the way she is of them. She will encourage them to develop their innate talents and make sure they don't go unnoticed.
    A Scorpio woman can drown you in her passion. But then, she can also bring you to safety when the raft becomes too dicey. She can provide you her calm and steady support in the worst of circumstances. Once you win her love, you will never be lonely again. Your food will be perfectly baked and she will grind fresh coffee for you. You will always come back to a spotless home, radiating with the aura of her magnetic personality, the charm of her deep beauty and the warmth of her everlasting love!

    A Scorpio child will usually have a stronger body than the rest of the kids. It is just perfect to support his much stronger will. He will never play or compete just for the heck of it. The aim of winning is always the main reason for it and he will never compromise on this front. He may give in at one point of time, to find some other way through which his victory will be assured. A Scorpio baby has a very hypnotic gaze, under which most of the people feel uncomfortable. So, it is better if you prepare yourself to outstare him every time.
    You will have to make him understand that you are the boss of the house and he has to accept the rules you have made. Say it softly but firmly, while staring him down. He will need to be constantly disciplined. You will have to teach him to be considerate towards the weak, inculcate sportsmanship, respect authority and learn to forgive those who hurt him. As per their characteristics profile, Scorpio children are sharp, brave, honest and tend to attract people with their magnetic personality. However, you need to teach them humility before it's too late.
    When your Scorpio baby does something wrong, don't shout at him. Learn to say 'No' in a kind, but unyielding manner. Show him that you are stronger than him and only then, will he learn from you. While disciplining him, don't forget to give him love and affection. Just like the other kids, he also needs constant cuddling and pampering. If you fail to do this, he may become too nervous, fearful and fidgety, which is completely opposite to his natural self. His honesty may make him a little blunt and direct and you will need to teach him to sheath his sharp tongue.
    A Scorpio child has his own secrets and he won't like you prying around them. He will seldom tell his own feeling, but you will find it almost impossible to do the same with him. He has the ability to sense when something is wrong. You will get bear hugs and tender touches from him when something is troubling you, even though you may have not told him the problem. He can just feel it. One of the basic personality traits of a Scorpio baby is loyalty and dedication, towards family as well as close friends.
    He has an angry side and whoever dares step on his tail, remembers not to do it again in their whole lifetime. You will have to teach him that revenge and grudge is not good. He will always be leading, whether in academics or sports or extra-curricular activities. He will always be full of energy and you will have to keep him involved mentally and active physically. Scorpio children tend to see unusual dreams and it is advisable to encourage them. You never know when he might become the next 'Robert Kennedy'.
    He knows what he is and what he wants and it is better not to impose your will on him. Though he looks placid on the outside, inside he is brimming with passions and emotions. A Scorpio child needs a congenial home atmosphere, or he might lose his usually calm self. Don't scold him without a reason and don't stop him from doing anything without giving him a logical reason. He has a fascination for dangerous things like fire, drugs, etc. So, it's better to keep them away from his reach.
    Scorpio baby is as much interested in unusual and mystic stuff as in the opposite sex. He may wink at the neighborhood girl when he has just started walking. Romance is in his blood and you will never be able to prevent him from falling in love. Still, you need to make him cautious in this area, so as to prevent heartbreaks that can affect him deeply. He will give his best in whatever he does and has determination to get what he wants. At the same time, he needs your love and support. Just be there when he needs you and teach him how to love and be loved. He will always come back to you to make sure that you are still there for him!
