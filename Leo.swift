However, his ego is very vulnerable and he will get deeply hurt if you don't respect his wisdom. It is difficult to ignore the lion for too long, he will be the center of attraction sooner or later.

However, he will always be the best-dressed person at the party. His behavior always borders on the extreme. A Leo will either be extremely careless and sloppy or meticulously neat and orderly.

A Leo man is extremely possessive of his loved ones and as far as you are concerned, you belong to him and him only.

When pushed too far, he will send that man thrashing to the floor, if not the hospital. If you said you would be gone for two hours, be back in one hour and fifty-nine minutes. When a Leo male becomes unreasonable, it is advisable to pamper him and get your work done. His vanity may at times come in the way, but then, you will have to subdue it with love, care and your own stability.

A Leo man is not one of those who forget to say 'I Love You' till the next anniversary. You will be showered with attention and compliments every now and then. He will also remain faithful to you, though he may look at the pretty faces every now and then. However, don't take that too seriously and leave him. He will be very hurt and may go to the extreme of faking a heart attack to get you back.
    Your part of the responsibility is to make sure that the romance never goes out of the relationship, even after the kids have come. Don't ever sideline your Leo man, not even for the kids. Then, he will remain contended and will play the perfect protective father to the children. He may not be very good with finances and this is where you will be required to provide some stability. There is a gambler streak in almost every Leo male and he will have to learn to keep it under limits. He is very good at repairing things around the house and this part of his characteristics profile may come quite handy to you.
    He has a very bad temper and it will be displayed when you show him disrespect or indifference. Then, he can turn hotter than a burning furnace. Apart from that, he has a very cool demeanor. Leo men make wonderful, warm and loving fathers. In this area also, they demand respect and it is again your duty to ensure that the kids do not forget their manners. Always remember that a Leo guy secretly fears being ridiculed and his pride is just a veil for his fears. So, make sure to keep him nourished with love, care and respect. You will be rewarded with a loving husband, who will never let you be lonely again!

    Leo child likes to lead everywhere, in the house, in the playground and in the class. He has to be the leader in all the kiddy games or he will start sulking. He has to go the way he wants to and as long as it remains this way, he will be bright, cheerful, mischievous, and happy. The moment he is forced to go some other way, he will either fight like an angry lion or broodingly retreat like a hurt lion. A Leo baby is always enthusiastic and full of bright ideas and it is better to encourage him.
    Though most of these ideas will be concerning him only, do not put them down. Otherwise, he may get scarred for the rest of his life. He may try to boss around other children, but that is one of his basic personality traits. Try to subdue him gently, but never scold him openly in front of everyone.

A Leo child will go to any extent to maintain his dignity, even if it means not crying after falling from the bicycle for the third time. He loves attention and somehow, manages to get it also.

    Leo boys are totally masculine and the girls completely feminine. Right from his childhood, a Leo baby will dislike small chores and resist doing it.

However, he may get lazy in respect of studies and you will have to show extreme patience to make him work hard. Another way is to make him see how superior he will be to other children, if he attains the top position.
    You will never find your Leo child making airplanes of his class assignments again. Do remember to compliment him and pat him on the back when he comes first in the class. He needs more compliments, no matter how much he's already got. The term savings is alien to most of the Leo children and they are prone to extravagance.

    The fiery spirit of Leos is the result of the domination of their ruling planet, Sun. As per astronomy; Sun is a star, not a planet. However, as far as astrology is concerned, it is deemed to be a planet, that too the ruling planet of Leo sun sign. It is believed to have been named after Apollo, the Roman Sun God. Sun lends an energetic, lively and forceful personality to the individuals born under the Leo zodiac. Their qualities are seldom repressed and their plans are, more often than not, put into concrete action.
    Sun-ruled people are inclined towards acquisition of knowledge and artistic achievement. The planet infuses in them a great degree of optimism, which encourages them to accept failures as only temporary setbacks in the road to success. This quality is often visualized by others as symbolical of their exceptionally good luck. Such individuals are full of self-respect, honesty and loyalty. They have excellent communication skills and tend to have a very attractive personality.
    The negative traits associated with the people dominated by the ruling planet of Sun include the tendency to overlook small matters and lay emphasis on individual fame, rather than high achievement. This may lead to a demanding, overbearing, egocentric, thoughtless and insensitive personality. They may also become too proud, insensitive, arrogant and imperious. If such traits are displayed for too long, they may totally overshadow the gifts owned by these individuals. Sun governs the self, aim, spirit, will, power, strength and order.
    Along with generosity, it imparts qualities like creativity, self-respect and honor. The influence of the ruling planet is mainly on how a person will express himself, how he will conduct himself and what direction will he take to accomplish his goals. The items related to Sun are marigolds, daffodils, lavender, cedar and palm trees, oranges, grapes, lions, peacocks, swans and cats. The metal closely associated with it is gold and the closest stones are carbuncles, rubies and diamonds.
