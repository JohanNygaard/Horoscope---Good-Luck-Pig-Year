    Dual-natured, elusive, complex temperament and contradictory are terms that best describe a Gemini. Just like the sign of twins, a Gemini is capable of producing the virtue of versatility and the vices of two-facedness and flightiness at the same time. He can never ever be boring as he loves communicating and gossiping. His talk is not rubbish, rather interesting and informative. He will have lots of friends and neighbors; in fact, he will keep in touch with anyone on his wavelength. Ruled by the Mercury planet, Gemini guys often get easily bored, impatient and frustrated by things that move slowly. Basically, they are intelligent, imaginative, lively and adaptable to any situation and person.
    Gemini people are very active and hence, tend to injure or infect themselves in areas like hands, arms, legs, thymus gland and upper ribs. They easily get subjected to mental distraction and hovering between alternatives. Though they feel less confident and have less faith in themselves, they are unaware about the capability of using their flexible mind in a surprising numerous ways to their benefit. With a highly flexible body, Gemini people love agile sports like gymnastics, bicycling, swimming and others. Due to their love for talking, they spend less time on eating and hence, generally stay fairly slim and fit. Belonging to a dual sign, Gemini people are chameleons, as they blend well with their environment and at the same time, stand out apart in a gathering with witty remarks and seemingly limitless knowledge.
    Gemini people are very attractive when they are good, but when they are bad, they are worse than what one can expect. They love to play the game of life filled with fresh moves and continuous entertainment. Changing decisions in the mid of a race distinguishes a Gemini from the rest, as sticking to a particular decision is difficult for them. Affectionate, courteous, kind, generous and thoughtful towards the poor and suffering: a Gemini exposes these traits only when they do not interfere with their personal lives. They are smart enough to use their outward attractiveness to achieve their goals, be it unscrupulous lying, cunning evasiveness or escaping blame by contriving to put it on others.
    When happy, a Gemini is honest and straightforward but when things go against him, he can sulk like a kid. Furthermore, a Gemini demands attention, admiration, energy and money, and dedication of time on him during childhood. Gemini makes a charming companion and you are lucky enough if you have a Gemini friend as he is the best person to approach for advice. Generous with his friends, a Gemini likes spending considerable time with them and loves to share everything. He judges a person by the way they treat him rather than looking into their personal qualities and traits. Often, this leads to wrong impressions, thereby leading to problems in relationships. A Gemini can be identified by a cell phone as it is the most treasured accessory for him.

    If you are one of those who need a constant reassurance in love, then don't even think of getting close to a Gemini man. He will always be there for you, but it will not be the same as being always there with you. His characteristic profile makes him restless and fidgety; so don't expect him to be at the same place for too long. Being suspicious wouldn't do much good either. If you still want to be with him, prepare yourself to accept his impatience. Once you have done this, you will be treated to the company of two, at times three-four men.
    A Gemini male has a dual nature, which can get extended to three-four different personalities too. His typical personality traits include friendliness, love for people and getting along with almost everyone. He can talk on any topic under the sun, is an excellent conversationalist and has a witty nature. More often than not, he becomes the life of a party. Are you are thinking of dating him after seeing him at one of these parties? Go ahead, what he displayed at the party was his true self, but then, don't forget that he has three-four other identities also.
    One day, he may bring you flowers, candies and cards without any occasion. The very next, he may not meet you even after confirming the meeting just an hour back. Two days after that, he may turn into your worst critic. Then, suddenly he will be the same guy he was on the first day. You will be treated like a queen and start feeling like one too. Then, one day, he will suddenly propose you and you will forget all that happened in the past and say 'Yes'! Now comes the main part, when you have to live with a walking-talking enigma.
    If you are in love with a Gemini guy, forget terms like stability, security and consistency. In case you are extremely sensitive, it is better to move away now. However, if you can digest his quirkiness without complaining, you will be leading a life full of surprises and at times, shocks. You will be waking up with a different man each day (not literally!), though the change may be for the better. Just stay a little distant from him; too much closeness makes him nervous. Gemini men have a personal side, which they will never share with anyone, not even with their lover.
    The best way to extinguish the flame between both of you is to bring monotony and boredom into your relationship. He will run away. He loves, infact needs, change. Just be as curious and as interested in life, and its different aspects, as he is. He wants a female who can catch up with him mentally. A Gemini man will never mind if you defeat him at his mind games every now and then, infact he will be thrilled at getting an intelligent partner-cum-competitor. He is not an egoist and will want you to express your intelligence.
    A woman with brains turns him on. Geminis tend to move over old friends and make new ones, but that's because their personality changes so frequently that people find it difficult to cope up with them. They love people and loneliness disturbs them. To win the heart of a Gemini male, just assure him that you are the one who will always be near him, but won't get too close to him or lean on him. He will gladly take you with him and let you see all that he sees. He is usually generous with money, but may turn stingy at times.
    However, his basic nature includes a sharing attitude, in case of money, knowledge, happiness and almost everything. A Gemini man is too idealistic to indulge in adultery and loyalty is something you will not have to worry about. However, he may throw admiring glances at the hot babes on the beach. Just don't doubt him; it may trigger him to do something he didn't even think of doing before. You may try as much as you can to hide your suspicions from him, but he will be able to guess and that would make him miserable.
    A Gemini guy loves an audience, whether it comprises of males or females. However, it will never go beyond that, unless of course you doubt him. Just like he has male friends, he will have female friends too. It is better if you make them your friends too. Don't try to bind Gemini men too much and let them have their independence and freedom. In return, they will do the same for you. They make excellent fathers, who are more like buddies to their children. A Gemini man will cuddle them with love, compete with them like a friend and protect them like a father.
    However, you will have to take over the responsibility of disciplining them. A Gemini male is not prone to jealousy and he will never be extremely possessive. He will trust you as much as he expects you to trust him. He may lack passion, but he will be full of romance. Just hear the same music he hears and see the same dreams he sees. Is he running? Try to catch up with him. If you get tired on the way, don't worry. He will stop for you, hold your hand and build up your strength to run with him again!

    Marrying one Gemini woman is like living with two different wives. Confused? Don't be, we are just talking about her dual personality. She has a dual nature and is capable of displaying different personality traits at different points of time. However, your major task will be to get her to commit. She is so fidgety that it becomes very difficult for her to become deeply involved with one person or place. The mind of a Gemini female never settles down at one place and her thoughts are always wandering.
    However, if you do manage to blend with her at the mental, spiritual as well as physical level, you will be introduced to a woman full of passion. In her youth, she is least likely to be bounded by a relationship or commitment. She may love your most irritating habits one minute and be extremely sarcastic about your new stylish haircut the very next. Maturity may bring a little bit stability in her. All this doesn't mean that Gemini women are not romantic at all. Infact, for them, romance is the one of the easiest means of communication.
    Since they always have some thoughts to express, romance never goes out of their life. However, commitment is an entirely different term. A Gemini girl may love your intelligence, but she will also notice your lack of interest in creative arts. It is same the other way round too. Puzzled? You should be, at times, even she is baffled by her own complex nature. She is so vivacious and full of life that with her, you will forget even the deepest of troubles. She has the ability to light up the most somber of surroundings with her presence.
    A Gemini woman will be full of the small, sentimental gestures that keep alive the romance in a relationship. She will always find new ways of telling you how much she loves you and will shower you with her alluring charm. She may act like a typical woman at one point of time, be a nervous wreck the other minute and engage in an intelligent conversation the very next second. She has the feminine charms, but she will never be clinging on to you. One thing that you will never find in a Gemini woman's characteristics profile is monotony and boredom.
    She finds something good in all the men she meets and then, wants a man who has all of those qualities. However, this can't be and then, she keeps longing for that perfect man! She can be your best friend, your sports partner, your racing competitor and your lover, all at the same time. Just remember one thing, she is single-handedly giving you all this, so don't expect consistency from her. A Gemini female can look at other guys, even when she is sincerely in love with you. Change is in her nature and she has to learn to control her own behavior. Just make sure to keep her interested in you and she will remain totally devoted.
    She will never be suspicious of you and will expect the same from you in return. You may be out till 3 in the morning and she won't even bat an eyelid. A Gemini girl will always respect your individuality and you will be required to do the same. She may forget to do the dishes every now and then, but you can have the most soul-satisfying conversations with her. She will keep your intellect as well as creativity stimulated. Motherhood will come naturally to her and she will make a happy and gay mother, who will respect the individuality of the children.
    Gemini woman makes an excellent hostess and will charm the guests with her grace. They will be treated to the best of cuisine, that too in silver cutlery. She can easily get along with anyone, right from your boss to the peon of your office. With a Gemini wife, you will feel as if you are with a different woman every other day. When she wants to speak, she will speak and when she wants to fly, she will fly. You don't know how she flies; just listen to her imagination and you will know. She is full of hopes, desires and dreams and you are welcome to share them. Just make sure that you are with her when she needs you!

    Having a Gemini child is like being in the roller coaster ride all the time. You will always be on you toes, trying to catch up with him. The moment he starts walking, you better put your jogging shoes on. However, don't ever try to confine him to a single place like a playpen. It will make him totally miserable. His characteristics profile makes him an explorer, a seeker. Restricting him too much may hamper his emotional development. Gemini children belong to the air sign and just like air; they have to be constantly on the move.
    Patience is not one of their personality traits, they find it difficult to remain steady for a long time and have the habit of doing more than one things at a time. They may become slower with age, but will remain fidgety nonetheless. As per the characteristics profile of a Gemini baby, he is extremely friendly, active, curious and intelligent. He has a dual personality and it is better to accept it. However, the doubling will be there in case of talents also. He has a way with words and can easily play with alphabets. He also loves conversing with others and sharing his knowledge with them.
    A Gemini child is quite humorous and has a sharp witty side. For him, fantasy and reality have been blended together and he lives in both the worlds. He may exaggerate the truth a bit, but it will be completely harmless and done with the aim of presenting a more colorful situation. However, don't reprimand him for this. Rather, ask him to pen down his imagination, but always speak the truth. Never ever try to stop a Gemini child from expressing himself or communicating with others.
    Otherwise, he may withdraw into an illusionary world in self-defense. Punctuality and Gemini are two entirely opposite terms. He will always be running into someone or something on the said time, because of which he will get late. He will hardly listen to something without interrupting, mostly because he has already guessed the rest of the story. However, more often than not, he himself will repeat what he has already said. Geminis have a very short span of concentration and tend to get distracted very easily.
    Telephone is something without which no Gemini can survive, whether he is an adult or a child. At times, it seems that he was born with a phone in each hand. This is because he cannot live without conversing with people. He changes his mind too often and is always on his way to somewhere. Every other day, he might change his plans about future also. But then he is adorable, isn't he? Remember, even when you have a single child who's a Gemini, with his dual nature, he will compensate for the other one too.
