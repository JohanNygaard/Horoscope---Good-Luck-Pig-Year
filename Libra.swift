    Libra, The Balance, is the seventh sign of the zodiac. The first and foremost personality trait you will notice about a Libran is his politeness. He loves people and hates to be rude to anyone. However, crowds do not attract him. A Libran is extremely good at solving a quarrel between two people quite amicably. On the other hand, he always enjoys having a good-natured argument himself. As per the Libra characteristic profile, the people born under this zodiac sign are usually very pleasant, cheerful and friendly.
    One thing that ticks off a Libran is taking orders. You order him around and he will become the sulkiest person on this earth. As you try to give a typical description of the Libran personalities, you will find a number of inconsistencies in them. On one hand, Librans are very intelligent, on the other; they may be amazingly naive and susceptible. They talk too much, but are patient listeners too. They come across as restless, but seldom seem to be in a hurry. Confused? Don't worry; they are as confused about this contradictory behavior as you are.
    A Libran will be composed, balanced, lovable, courteous and amiable half of the time. In the other half, he will be exasperating, irritable, inflexible, fidgety, unhappy and mystified. He is always tipping to one side or the other, till the perfect balance is achieved. Librans have a very captivating smile, which can easily melt your heart. Even their laughter rings with gaiety and seems to brighten up even the dullest of surroundings. They are very delightful when their mind in a balanced state. However, a Libra mind is prone to fickleness.
    He is always weighing the pros and cons of a situation and finds it very difficult to form the perfect, balanced, opinion. He has this annoying habit of starting an argument just for the heck of it. You may have heard that Librans are lazy, but in this case also, there is a contradiction. They will keep on working for weeks, even months, at a time, managing on four-hours sleep everyday. Then, suddenly, they will feel completely exhausted and go into the laziness spell. Once this happens, it is impossible to even make them move a limb.
    After sometime, a Libran will again be his energetic self and be out of the door even before you can say bye. However, it does not mean that he has a dual nature. It's just that he needs the lazy spell to regain his lost energy. As far as his emotions are concerned, he may become too sentimental one moment, turn sarcastic the other moment and become extremely cheerful in the very next. Again, it's not their dual personality, but a Libran's constant need to experience different emotion at different points of time.
    Infact, his personality is a mix of kindheartedness, softness, equality, indecisiveness, theoretical logic and inability to take orders. He also loves to argue, especially when someone passes general statements. A Libran can take both the sides of an argument by turns, and win at both. Infact, he can even switch sides in the middle of the argument. However, behind all this argumentativeness is the constant urge to be fair and impartial, to look at both the sides of the coin, making him seem indecisive.
    However, don't get impatient when a Libran is making up his mind. He hates impatience and it can make him extremely stubborn. He is very honest and does not like showing off. Librans love books and have the ability of concentrating and thinking over the deepest of subjects. They are very much impressed as well as influenced by the harmony of art forms. A Libran is artistic at heart and loves soft light, melodious music, intelligent conversation, good food and fine wines. He has a combination of intelligence, generosity, fairness and the need to be balanced.

    A Libran man can answer all your questions, but he cannot solve the puzzle of your typically girlish dreams. He likes to maintain a balance in everything he does and that includes love too. If you have been captivated by him once, there is a minuscule chance that you will be able to leave him. Even if try to back off, he will convince you with such persuasive arguments that you would be left with no other option, but to stay. He will cover the contradictions of his behavior with such charm that you will be entrapped once again, with nowhere to go.
    God help you if he smiles! You will fall in love with him again. Don't blame yourself; the smile of a Libra male is so captivating that not even his enemies can resist it. Now, when you are totally enamored, you are bound to forget your own existence. His charm will result in you seeing his dreams and his happiness being your utmost priority. The first thing you will notice about him is that he finds it very difficult to make up his mind. If even after much deliberation, he has been able to do that, he may change his opinion in a split second if he thinks he made a mistake.
    If you really want to fight him, turn your back towards him while fighting and stuff your ears with cotton. If he looks at you with that smile of his and starts his convincing arguments in that smooth tone, you won't stand a single chance of winning. As far as romance is concerned, your Libra guy will never fall short of it. He can use his pleasing manner and graceful charm and win any girl in sight. Once he wins her heart, he is not too sure what to do with it and this is when the problems start. Even if the situation demands a break up, he will always try to postpone it as much as he can.
    Though he does this just to make sure that this is what is best for the both of them, he hurts a person's feelings in the process. Even the opposite case, when he is deciding whether to propose marriage or not, is equally painful. On top of that, if he thinks he is being unfair to you, the confusion gets more pronounced. Libran men tend to confuse love with friendship and vice-versa. They keep searching for the perfect girl and if the relationship doesn't turns out to be as they expected it, they become a little heartbroken and then move on with life.
    A lost love seldom makes a deep wound in a Libran heart. It forgives and forgets. A Libra man is never interested in prying out your secrets. He delves deeper into a topic just to get a fair view of it and not with the aim of dissecting a situation. All he wants are the facts, not the personal nuances lying underneath them. He will from an opinion about your behavior, but he wouldn't take too much pain to know why you behave the way you do. A Libran is like a judge who passes his judgments on the basis of the facts, not the emotions triggering them. He is not interested in gossip and is not the one to tell your personal secrets to anyone.
    So, you can trust him with all your heart. A Libran male will listen to your inner dreams, desires and hopes. However, do not expect him to understand your silent hopes. He is not good at that and all your hopes may come thrashing to the ground. You will have to learn to live with it. At the same time, don't expect him to take your side when you are wrong. He has built-in mechanism of being fair, even when it involves you. A Libran guy is generous with money and stinginess is not one of his personality traits.
    His house will be full of guests every now and then, but he dislikes going to crowded places that are full of strangers. He likes people, but if the numbers become too large, he becomes uncomfortable. If you are planning to get married to him, develop the habit of keeping the house neat, clean and full of good fragrances. A Libran guy cannot tolerate sloppiness and pungent cooking smells make him feel depressed. He may be careless and shoddy himself, but you will be expected to keep yourself, the kids as well as the house attractive all the time. He may not say anything about this, but his behavior will.
    Staying out till late, sleeping all the time he is at home, etc, are some of the signs that things are not right. This is something you will have to analyze and correct. Otherwise, you may lose a very devoted, generous, fair and pleasing husband, who has a smile that can melt any heart. As a father, a Libra male will teach his kids the sense of fairness, discipline and debate. He will dote on them, but they will never come before you. His fatherly affection won't overshadow his romantic feelings for you. Just remember to take initiative in the relationship, keep him loved and nourished and he will always keep you warm with his captivating smile!

    A Libran female is total woman, complete with the charming manners and delightful elegance. She can also argue with the convincing male logic and beat you at any argument. However, the male side may come in front of you after sometime. Debate attracts her and she weighs both sides of the situation with total fairness. A Libra girl may start an argument alone and finish it alone, with your contribution being only some occasional comments. While she is arguing with you, she may smile every now and then.
    Before you know it, you will feel captivated by her smile and charm. By this time, she would have won the argument as well as your heart. Of course, you won't mind that, since she convinces with such carefully balanced and logical arguments. A typical Libran female characteristics profile includes a constant need to be fair and balanced. The best part is that she presents her case in such a tactful way that you don't feel offended at all. At the same time, she is not stubborn and easily changes her mind if she finds your arguments more logical and convincing.
    She will never stick to a viewpoint just because its hers and your opinion will matter to her as much as her own. Libran women love luxurious surroundings and sloppy, dirty surroundings make them feel depressed. If subjected to such environs for too long, they can fall physically ill too. Most of them work after marriage. Apart from money, one of the basic reasons for this is that for them, marriage is also like a partnership and both the partners have to carry out the responsibilities together.
    Solitaire is not their kind of game. A Libra woman never seeks to dominate in a relationship and the husband always gets the respect he deserves. At the same time, she keeps him from making mistakes or taking wrong decisions. He takes the lead and she tries to smooth out the results of his decisions. She will never go against his decisions, but if he's wrong, she will slowly tread him to the correct path. She is emotional, but not while forming opinions or passing judgments. At that point of time, facts are what matters to her the most.
    Being suspicious is not one of the personality traits of a Libran girl. She trusts you completely and opening your personal mail will be wrong in her eyes. She expresses her emotions easily and lavishly; you will never find yourself complaining in this aspect. There will be no dearth of charming glances, gentle strokes, affectionate hugs and loving kisses. After marriage, you will never come back to a dirty home. Everything will be spick and span, right from your drawing room to your wife to the kids.
    A Libra female loves talking, but she will patiently listen to your monologues too. She is all feminine, where love and romance is concerned. However, when some crisis situation crops up, she will be as strong as any man. She will always be there to help you, motivate you, build up your strength and support you. With children, she will be loving, caring and a little strict, especially where respecting you is concerned. She will dote on them, but they will never come before you. You were the first love of her life and she will never forget that.
    She will never let the kids disrespect you and your needs will always come first. If you become too strict with them, she will be there to wipe their tears and give them the chocolate you denied. A Libra woman may become a little imbalanced once in a while. Still, the harmony and balance will return soon and she will become her usual lovable self again. She is one of the few females who can play the princess with the perfect captivating charm and, with as much ease, lend you a supporting hand in crisis. And she melts your heart with that enticing charm and alluring smile too!

His sweet expression, chubby cheeks and captivating smile are sure to win hearts of nearly all the people around him. He also seems very calm and composed and you will seldom find him screaming without a reason. Now comes the not-so-nice part! One thing you should never give a Libran baby is a choice; he will seldom be able to make a decision easily. On top of that, if you force him to hurry up, forget that he will ever reach a conclusion.
    Since he takes time to make up his mind, he may appear to be stubborn. But, this is not true. He is just thinking which task to do first. Yelling wouldn't help. Infact, it will disturb his equilibrium state of mind and he will become more confused than ever. You give a Libran child some work, one task at a time and he will do it in a jiffy, since he will not be making any choice. You also have to be sure that you are not asking him to do something it too harshly. Mild tones work the best with him. Teach him how to make up his mind, in a very pleasant way.
    The best way to do this is to suggest him a solution again and again. Show him how to reach a conclusion time and again and gradually; he will get over his indecisiveness. A Libran baby likes harmony and discord disturbs his state of mind. He needs peace, quiet and rest much more than the other children. Things like loud voice and harsh colors do not suit him well. Whenever you start getting frustrated over his indecision, just remember it is in his characteristics profile and he can do nothing about it.
    One of the basic reasons for a Libra baby's vacillation is that he wants to be fair and balanced. He doesn't wants to misjudge a situation or a person and tends to weigh both the sides too much. One of the annoying personality traits of a Libran child is his laziness. He may not move an inch for hours at a time. Here, you will have to remember that he is not lazy in the literal sense. Infact, most of the time he is hyperactive. He needs these resting spells to regain his strength. Soon, he will be his energetic self again. Don't fuss with him about inactiveness; otherwise he may become lazier in self-defense.
    Libran children are quite gentle, kind, considerate and have a pleasant personality. They have the ability of softening even the hardest of hearts with their smile. They are very bright and have the ability of taking both the sides in a debate and then, winning both of them. A Libran child is found arguing many a times, since he cannot tolerate someone making a casual remark about something. According to him, you have to look at both the sides of the coin and only then should you comment on a situation or a person.
    You won't be facing much problem in making him adhere to the rules, as long as you have managed to convince him about them. With a Libran baby, you will have to sharpen your wits every now and then. He may argue about anything under the sun and then, you will need logic to support your side. He is entirely faithful and you can easily tell him any secret. He believes in maintaining the trust of people and will seldom indulge in gossip. Don't expect him to take your side if you are wrong.
    A Libra child has a strong sense of fairness, which forces him to take the side of only that person who is right. Of course, he will take time making up his mind about who is right. He will respect your privacy and expect the same from you. He will also be quite neat and orderly, since he hates mess. Art and beauty is something in which almost all the Librans maintain an interest. He will also have his days of kiddy romance. All said and done, your Libran child will be delight to nurture, especially with those cute dimples and that captivating smile of his!
