    Taurus zodiac sign is represented by the symbol of 'The Bull' and just like a bull, a Taurus person is strong and silent. In the first instance, a Taurean comes across as extremely quiet and reserved person. Only after you get close to him will you have a proper conversation, rather than simple monologues. He moves deliberately and is as steady as the 'Rock of Gibraltar'. Once a Taurus has made up his mind, it is impossible to move him even slightly. If you leave him alone, a Taurean will come across as a very easygoing person.
    You push him somewhat and he becomes stubborn. Still trying to make him budge, beware of the violent temper. A Taurus person is hardly impulsive and never gets angry without a reason. In fact, he has the perfect control over his emotions. However, when a Taurus does get angry, it is better not to get in the way or you are bound to get trampled. The anger also takes time to come down. He is quite attracted to the opposite sex, but attracting people to himself seems more preferable to him.
    One of the typical personality traits of a Taurus is passivity. You can count on him to be there when you need him, but he will never be the one to call on you. At the same time, he will know 'what to do' and 'how to do it'. Worrying, fretting or getting nervous is definitely not one of Taurus characteristics. It is in his nature to be stable and stoic. He takes his decisions slowly, after careful considerations. Taurus people love their home and change upsets them. Don't tell a Taurus that he's stubborn; he'll never believe it. He thinks himself to be patient, not obstinate.
    Taureans have this amazing quality of bearing emotional and physical pain, even for years, without grieving or complaining. The more the troubles come pouring in, the stronger he will come out to be. A Taurus is nothing if not loyal and dedicated to his family and friends. He has a good appetite and loves food and drinks. He has a funny bone too; it's just that he prefers broad and slapstick comedy to subtle humor. Taureans are hardly cruel. At the same time, they are seldom broke. Sooner or later, the money will come to them.
    A Taurus is not stingy and his pockets, along with his heart, are always open to friends and family. He loves grandeur and he is deeply interested in the various forms of art. Music usually has a very special place in his life. The ideas of a Taurus are always sensible as well as practical. He is not the one to build castles out of air. Synonymous with lasting love, Taurus people are not prone to wandering. They love luxury, but detest waste and extravagance. Last but not the least, they are dependable, strong, patient and trustworthy.

    A typical Taurus man comes across as a very calm, quiet, practical, composed, humble as well as levelheaded person. He takes one step at a time, that too after much deliberation. He is not the one who 'falls in the love at the first sight'. A Taurus male will take time to decide whether you are the person with whom he can spend his entire life. However, if he makes up his mind that you are the one for him, he will go to any lengths to win your love. These efforts include being romantic to the core, sending you flowers, writing poems for you, etc.
    Taurean men are always protective of their loved ones and will be very gentle and pleasant towards them. When in love, they are very romantic and will express the same with small little gestures. You may be given flowers every other day, taken to the most romantic place in the town and wished on all the important days of your life, like the first time you met him. If you want to stir the emotions of a Taurus male, the best way is to play some soothing, romantic songs. Building castles in the air is not one of the traits of a Taurus guy's personality.
    He won't promise you the stars, but he will gift you the diamond necklace you saw in the jewelry shop two days back. With him, you will never feel insecure about the future. His characteristics profile includes qualities like calm strength, stable nature and peaceful ways, all of which are sure to win your heart. A Taurus man does not believe in taking chances and will always be prepared for the worst of circumstances. If you want to attract him, it is better to start brushing up your lady charms right now.
    He doesn't want a tomboyish wife. You will be expected to behave like a lady. When you are in a public place, let your Taurean male be the brighter one of the two. Don't misunderstand him. He respects your intelligence, but don't make him feel embarrassed by contradicting his statements in public. If you make this mistake, remember to say sorry afterwards or you are doomed. Never ever try to push him or you will have to face his violent temper. In case you just did that, remain with him and try to calm him. z
    Don't even think of going to your mom's flat for the weekend. You are his wife, he loves you and you have to live with him. A Taurus guy will also not tolerate outsiders interfering in his house, be it your mother or anyone else. He wants a girl who is close to him, but is not clinging on to him forever. He wants his freedom and will let you enjoy your freedom too. You will be allowed to indulge in all you feminine fashions. Infact, a Taurean man will enjoy watching you do the typical feminine stuff, that too with patience.
    However, remember that he is the boss of the house and come back to him when he asks you to. If you do this, you will be treated with the most pleasant and agreeable husband on this earth. Just let him handle the reins and he will do anything and everything for you. Don't expect him to announce his love ten days after meeting you. Taurean men take time to truly comprehend their emotions, but when they do, they make sure that they get their love. Love blindfolds them and they become generous to all the flaws of the relationship.
    A Taurean male loves nature and its beauty. When he settles down, he wants crisp bread, sparkling cutlery and perfectly baked apple pie. Don't expect him to eat that burnt sandwich, without saying anything. As a father, he will be tender, demonstrative, warm and understanding. A Taurus man is extremely hard working and thus, needs to rest every now and then. Don't ever push him or accuse him of being lazy when he is walking at his own leisurely pace. If you are thinking of getting married to him, develop the habit of keeping the house clean and warm.
    He wants his home to look like a home, not a garbage dump. Don't worry; he won't be criticizing you all the time. Infact, most of the time, he will be generous to even those faults on which other males complain. Just remember to make a Taurus man feel like the head of the family and let him handle all the responsibilities. He will provide you a cozy nest, which will be full of love, warmth, care and concern. He is stubborn, but only when you provoke him. Otherwise, he is the most patient man you will ever find. Be happy. You have a real man besides you, who will wrap his arms around you, protect you & love you forever!

    When you come across a Taurus female, the first thing you will notice about her is her undefeatable emotional strength. She is capable of handling the severest of problems, without shedding even a single tear. She has the infamous Taurus temper, but it is seldom displayed. Atleast not until the provocation is too much to digest. She is as feminine as any other female, without the unnecessary tantrums.
    A Taurus woman has no desire of dominating her husband. She will let him handle the reins, infact this is what she secretly desires. A Taurus woman wants a real man, who can make her proud of himself as much as she is proud of herself. However, if he fails in his role, she will take the control in her own hands. Neither will she act like a mewing kitten, nor like a roaring lioness. She is independent and has a mind of her own, but she does not want to dominate in the relationship. Taurean women do not see social status while making their friends. They want to be friends with people who do not hide their true nature and come across as they really are.
    Their friends may be a little weird, but they will not be phonies or hypocrites. A Taurus girl doesn't fight with people she dislikes, she simply ignores them and becomes indifferent to their presence. However, she will be loyal to her true friends and they will remain with her throughout her life. In return, she will expect them to stand by her when she needs them. A Taurean woman also gets jealous, but only if you exceed the limits of casual flirtation. Everything has a limit and this also does. It's better not to provoke her anger or you will be very sorry.
    She is brainy, but not too much interested in intellectual subjects. She is practical in her thinking and does not feel the need to indulge in mental gymnastics. She is balanced in her approach and you will hardly see her in a restless disposition. A Taurean girl hates anything artificial, be the flowers in her vase or the friends in her life. She has to feel the fragrance of real roses and the presence of real people. The beauty of Mother Nature especially pleases her.
    Ugliness of any kind makes her miserable and repulsive. She loves to be amidst colorful surroundings, like gardens blooming with flowers. A Taurean female has a good taste, so please be very careful before taking her out. She is a very good cook herself and you will always be treated to excellent homemade food. She is also very much interested in the art forms, like painting. She is a tomboy at heart and will enjoy many guy-things like horse riding, going on a roller coaster ride, fishing, etc.
    All this makes her feel close to nature. She dresses simply, yet elegantly and her fabrics are always feather-soft. Taurus female is very strong and above the usual female insecurities. However, she demands loyalty and will never compromise in this area. She is beyond hypocrisy and has an undemanding and easy-going manner. She wants her man to take her side, especially in public. If he contradicts her in front of other people, expect the temperature to reach beyond the boiling point.
    When pushed too far, she loses her cool demeanor quickly. Taurus women make excellent mothers, except for the fact that they cannot tolerate disobedience or defiance in kids. Laziness and carelessness also makes them angry. Otherwise, they will be more of a friend to their children than the typical mommies. A Taurus woman will also teach the kids how to be strong and will protect them from the big bad outside world. She never shirks from or whines about her responsibilities. Her man will be expected to do the same.
    She can also bear endless pain and stress, without complaining for a single minute. She is good with finances and knows how to maintain quality in a reasonable budget. She is a very good host and will be there to help her man in any and every way she can. A Taurean woman will care for you when you are ill, will back you in your new business venture and let you take over the control of the home. And, you will always be treated to a warm, cozy home when you come back from office!

    First things first! A Taurus child does what he likes to do and pushing him against his will gets you nowhere. Every time you try to make him do something he doesn't want to, he will adopt the same stance a bull has when it doesn't wants to move. Push him a little and you hear that loud grunting noise that further marks his displeasure. Apart from his stubborn attitude, a Taurean baby mostly has totally delightful personality traits. He always looks so chubby and so adorable and wants lots of affection. The more you hug him, the happier he will be.
    In return, he will also give you lots of hugs and kisses. Infact, he is very affectionate as well as demonstrative in case of people he trusts. A Taurean boy is always his mum's favorite and a Taurean girl is always her daddy's dearest. The boy will be totally masculine, while the girl will be totally feminine. Some of the Taurus girls may turn out to be tomboys. However, they will still have all the charms of a female to call upon whenever they want. A Taurus child often comes across as more capable and proficient than the other children.
    He is also much more emotionally secure than them, without showing even the slightest traces of impulsiveness. He may become a little hesitant and negative at times, but will be free from most of the usual growing up tantrums. A Taurus baby is quite calm, cheerful and will maintain his composure till he is pushed to the limits against his will. There is nothing unpredictable about his behavior. Infact, he is more mature than almost all the other children. He enjoys company, but will become uncomfortable if he is made the center of attention.
    Vices like rudeness, attitude and insolence do not match with his characteristics profile. However, don't force anything on a Taurus child. He hates being bullied into something. Shouting or yelling will get you nowhere. Just show some genuine love and affection and he will easily follow what he was vigorously denying only few minutes back. Taurus children respond to common sense and logic. They want the straightforward and exact truth. Only practical and reasonable explanations can move them.
    Soothing colors and sounds always have a positive effect on a Taurean child. He is also likely to be interested in creative arts - like painting. He will be very sincere in his studies, good at memorizing, have excellent concentration powers and be extremely hard working. He does not have a rebellious nature and will dutifully adhere to whatever you say, as long as your tone is sweet not scathing. A Taurus baby may take a little more time to learn the facts, but has a very sharp memory and will remember the details throughout his life.
    If you have a May-born child, accept the fact that you cannot order him. It is the best to soften his heart by love. Pushing him will make him dig his heels in the ground and you will get nothing done. Both Taurus boys and Taurus girls are very dedicated to their loved ones and will go to any extent to help them. All they need is a cozy, comfortable home, where they are nurtured with love and care. Surround them with positive people and positive environment and they will help you in being contented and at peace with yourself one day!
