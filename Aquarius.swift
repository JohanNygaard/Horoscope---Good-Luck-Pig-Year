    Aquarius 'The Water Bearer' is the second last sign of the zodiac. An Aquarian lives in the real world, but he will talk about the future. He is very kind and peace loving, but likes going against the conventions every now and then. Usually, he is very soft spoken, but can surprise you by passing very offhanded remarks and statements. Every second person on this earth is his friend and he uses the term 'friend' very often. Every new thing interests an Aquarius, be it the new person at office, the new book at store or the new bartender at his usual pub.
    He loves to experiment, to explore. His next interest may be you and he will start dissecting you under the microscopic eyes. Then, just as you begin to think that you are the most important interest in his life, he will turn away, find something new and will be busy exploring again. You will be left all embarrassed and fuming. If you are someone who has an ego, it's better to be miles away from an Aquarius person. His eyes will always have an unclear, distant look. His personality traits include obstinacy, creativity, vanity and a love for freedom.
    On the other hand, his characteristics profile also comprises of humor, diplomacy, kindness, compassion and coyness. One moment, he will be surrounded by a crowd, immersing himself in the security of so many friends. However, soon he will feel extremely lonely and will want to be left alone. Whether he is gay or gloomy, one thing is for sure; an Aquarian will always be analyzing the people around him. In the process, he may ask you the most personal questions, without even batting an eyelid.
    Even though Aquarians have numerous friends, they don't have many close buddies. They are most interested in quantity and their friendships seldom last the entire life. Being steady in one relationship is not an Aquarian's cup of tea. There is always so much to discover, how can he remain tied to a few people only. However, if you do manage to touch his heart, he may come back to see what he failed to notice earlier. He lives in the future and people find it very difficult to cope up with him.
    This brings a sense of isolation from the rest of the world. An Aquarian is a genius, if he does not cross the line separating it from eccentricity. His personality is the perfect symbol of an odd mix of frostiness, realism and unconventional volatility. He is a friend to anyone and everyone. Though he has his bouts of solitude, he will soon be back to his normal self again. Just remember not to disturb him when he wants to be alone. Ignore him and he will come back again, all happy and cheerful.
    Aquarians dislike commitments of any kind. However, once they have made it, they will stick to it fully. They give their opinion very frankly, but never ever try to force them on anyone. In return, don't every dictate how they should live their life. They respect individuality and expect the same from you. An Aquarian is not a crusader and will rarely be fighting for a cause. He believes in revolution, but lets other people do the work required for bringing about the same. Once an Aquarian has made up his mind, it is difficult to move him.
    He is full of shocks and surprises and will hardly let you know what his motives are. He doesn't trust people easily, not until he has scrutinized each and every aspect of their personality. However, once he trusts you and makes you his friend, nobody in this world can sway him against you. An Aquarian has an extremely good concentration power. Even though it looks as if he is not even listening to you, he will know each and every word you said. He doesn't have a good memory, but he seems to know everything that is to be remembered.
    Aquarians have an amazing sixth sense and their intuition is very strong. They can also know your innermost desires, without even having a word with you. They can convey their thoughts as easily too. An Aquarian loves changes in everything, except his own personality. He also hates dishonesty and trickery, as much as he dislikes borrowing and lending money. However, he may, at times, fool you in completely harmless and subtle ways. In case he lends you something, be sure to give it back to him on the said time and date.
    An Aquarian is not the one to take a broken promise or bad debt easily. He keeps his word and pays his dues on time, so, why can't you. Accepting conventions and authority is beyond him, but he will respect them nonetheless. He loves freedom and pinning him down is a task that most of the people cannot accomplish. An Aquarian is far ahead of you, but still it is advisable to try to catch him. Your success cannot be guaranteed, but you will surely come out a little wiser in the process.

    There is hardly any person on this earth whom an Aquarius man doesn't like. He is a people's person and almost every second person he meets becomes his friend. If he likes you, you are one of the many people he has befriended. It is when he doesn't like you at all or he likes you way too much that there are chances he has noticed you from amongst his numerous pals. As per an Aquarian male, the best way to pass the time is to probe into people's life and know their innermost feelings.
    The same doesn't hold true for himself. He wants to hide his feelings from everyone and deliberately makes his reactions complex, just for the fun of fooling others. Love is just another experience for him, till he has been driven to the point of the altar. For him, all the people he has met hold a special place and special value. In the case of an Aquarian male, everyone is special, including those people whom he hasn't met yet. Selfishness is not one of his personality traits and he does not like small-mindedness.
    His ideals are quite high and he seeks change way too often. Then, suddenly one day, he may become totally calm and composed. It will take a lot of effort on to assure an Aquarius male that he has become interested in one woman above mankind. After the shock is over, he will become an extremely considerate lover. Then, he may realize that he is neglecting the rest of the world for her and the consideration might diminish just a little. If you are thinking of playing games with an Aquarius man, ensure that what he discovers in the end is worth all that play.
    In case it is not, he will just shrug and move on to the next mystery. Open books do not entice him and intriguing him will be your best. An unsuspecting female might feel way too important when he tries to probe her feelings. Then, she comes to know that he is as much interested in the bus boy or the new waitress. 'Poof', there goes her dream. Slowly and gradually, she cools down and finally, moves on to a more passionate guy. The Aquarian guy will sigh a little at her departure and then, get on with his next mystery.
    He will never ever tolerate a person taking undue advantage of his goodness. Then, he can turn scathingly bitter and can take some shocking actions too. If he does something likes this to you, don't take it with your mouth shut. He likes a woman who holds her ground. The characteristics profile of an Aquarius guy shows a fetish for cleanliness and personal hygiene. In some men, it may become too much to digest. However, we are talking about the moderate ones. He will not go to many extremes to woo you, but there will be no dearth of romantic gestures either.
    There are maximum chances that he will not be too comfortable with the whole idea of getting married. Infact, he usually looks for a female who acts as his best buddy, but makes no emotional demands. He isn't even good in expressing his love through physical gestures. 'I Love You' will take a long time to come and even after that; don't expect the issue of marriage to pop out next. He will churn out any excuse he can think of, to avoid it for as long as he can. Trying to invoke jealousy will not work, since he is not the one to come running to claim you.
    He will resign himself and say that he knew he didn't deserve you. If you haven't played such tricks, then wait. One day, though much time later, he will realize that all his friends are married. Sensing this as a mystery he hasn't solved till date, he will propose you out of the blue. Jealousy and possessiveness do not define his personality. An Aquarian man will never ever doubt you or be suspicious of your activities. If and when, he becomes jealous, he will never let you know about it.
    You will never have to worry about his loyalty too. He is not one of those who engage in dishonest relationships. Though you may get frequent reasons to be jealous, since he is so interested in people - both males as well as females. If you have asked him something, trust that his answer will be honest. It is better not to doubt an Aquarius man, or he can cook up the wildest story to add fuel to your suspicion. He will have his silent spells once in a while and during those periods, it is better to leave him alone.
    He will come back soon, all happy and gay. With him, you will never to worry about money. It will somehow come into his hands. Don't be extravagant with the finances or he will get hurt. Nevertheless, he will have outbursts of generosity every now and then. As fathers, most of the Aquarian men encourage their kids' imagination. They are patient listeners and good at math's problems too. Make sure that you do not neglect you Aquarius husband when the kids come along. At the same time, don't be on the phone with your kitty friends when he needs you.
    He married you so that he could have you around him all the time. So, always be there like a good wife and a good mother. An Aquarian man seldom forgets his first love, so make sure that you are the first girl who made him feel special. He may not be so romantic, but every now and then, he comes up with such beautiful lines that you feel as if you are soaring in the sky. He may forget birthdays or anniversaries, but suddenly he will say something so meaningful to you that will make up for all the lost time!

    Inconsistency and confusion describe the characteristics profile of an Aquarius female. The same goes for her love life too. She is very loyal, but at the same time, she is also a little detached and not extremely emotional. She will be committed and remain faithful too, but do not try to bind her. Let her enjoy her freedom and in return, she will come back to you when she gets tired of her expeditions. Her dreams are very different from that of a normal female and she hums a different tune, which most of us have not even heard of.
    An Aquarian female is like a butterfly, which sits on every flower, but belongs to none. She loves her freedom and if you can accept this, she will love you even more. Within her boundless limits, her love will also be limitless. Position and power matter to her more than money and bank balance. If you want her to fall in love with you, be true and honest, not only to others, but also to yourself. You don't need to follow her rules. You can form your own code of ethics, but be sure to live by them.
    Passion is not one of the personality traits of Aquarian girl. Rather, her love will be subtle and unassuming. She is intense, but may prefer to be platonic most of the time. Hosting as well as attending parties comes naturally to her and she will always be a social delight. She will trust you completely and will not be unduly suspicious of your activities. You will also not be bothered by too much jealousy or possessiveness on her part. Her trust arises from the fact that before committing, she had dissected your behavior under a microscope.
    Only after being convinced of your integrity did she take the next step. Still, if you become unfaithful to her, she will be extremely hurt and is likely to remember the wound for a long time. With an Aquarian female, out of sight means out of mind too. So, make sure to be around here always. She has a very strong will power. If she thinks the relationship is not working and has no chances of improving also, she will break it right away; though doing so may tear her heart into two pieces. Like every Aquarian, she will remember her first love throughout her life.
    It's no use getting upset, better be the first love in her life. She will never ever be dishonest in a relationship and even if she indulges in an extra-marital affair, it will end before it even started. She will always try to know your deepest thoughts and secrets, but her own dreams will be beyond your reach. Conversing with an Aquarian female is usually a delight because of her charming manners. Her mind is quite unpredictable and you will find it hard keeping track. She will live in the present, then suddenly be wistful about yesterday and then, become enthusiastic about tomorrow.
    She may talk about fairies one day and discard elves as humbug, the other. Never look down on her or she might never look upto you. She respects you and will expect the same in return. As mothers, Aquarian women tend to be very loving and caring. Though in the beginning, they may be a little nervous about the whole idea of motherhood. But once they become comfortable with it, it will come to them naturally. An Aquarius female may find it difficult to express her love in the form of hugs and kisses and you will have to teach her that. She will never overburden the kids with protection.
    At the same time, she will always be a patient listener to their childhood and adolescent problems. Teaching them discipline will also be your responsibility. However, for all this to happen you will have to convince her to get married and this certainly isn't an easy job. You will also have to teach her romance, since expressing emotions does not come too easily to her. She will happily hold your hand and walk besides you, but don't expect her to gaze into your eyes for hours at a stretch.
    Don't smother your Aquarian girl with too much closeness, she needs her space and will give you, yours too. Things like suspicion, possessiveness, chauvinism and criticism turn her off. Just be nice to her odd bunch of friends and she will warmly welcome yours into the house. Make use of her intuition and insight, it may help you in solving a problem or two. It may seem like wishful thinking now, but then, remember she looks in the future. Hold her hand and she will let you see the future too, where both of you are cozily living together!

    An Aquarius child is a sort of puzzle for his parents. He is sensitive, adamant, a little shaky, ingenious and impulsive, all at the same time. It becomes a little difficult to decide whether he is an extremely crazy youngster or an exceedingly intelligent prodigy. He may turn out to be the next Einstein or become an ordinary salesman at a departmental store. However, his future depends much upon how you shape his personality. Don't try to force your opinions on an Aquarian baby; he will vehemently oppose them.
    Just give him sometime and let him think over it, mostly probably he will find it correct and accept it in the end. You will hardly find his behavior predictable. From a usually calm and pleasant individual, he can suddenly turn into a stubborn and restless one. Inconsistencies and contradictions rule his characteristics profile. Aquarius children may not know where to go, but they always know which road to take. They demand logic behind every action and their personality traits reflect a blend of common sense and perception.
    They have a large number of friends and love to help their friends whenever they can. Your Aquarian child loves to chase dreams. No sooner will one be over that he will be chasing another one. Somehow, he never dreams what the other children dream of. For instance, he will never think about becoming a doctor, rather he will want to be an oceanographer. Even though he may have to settle down with the former, he will never forget the latter one and may even make it come true one day.
    Aquarians tend to be absent minded and this may result in quite a few accidents. Even at school, your Aquarian child may always be pointed out for not paying much attention. However, this will be supported by good grades, more often than not. On one hand, he has a good intuition and this helps him in arriving at the solution even before he has fully heard the problem. On the other hand, he tends to forget things like his home address way too often. He will have unusually intelligent thoughts every now and then, but they will not be in a logical sequence.
    You will have to teach your Aquarius baby to compile his thoughts in a proper order, so that they make sense. In the contrary, his genius would either go waste or it may lead to some eccentricity. He will not be too enthusiastic about sports, infact any kind of physical activity. Mentally, he will be thousand miles away from the other children in a jiffy. Nature will attract him and he will feel one with it. Aquarius children have a very sharp sixth sense and they can easily absorb the negative vibrations around them. This may lead to a disturbance in their emotional balance and break their usual tranquility and harmony.
    Encourage, don't force, them to do something. Before saying anything to an Aquarius child, measure your words carefully. They may make a lasting impression on his personality. He will have lots of friends, but romance is something he will take time to understand. Still, he loves people and tries to help them in every possible way he can. Do you think he dreams too much and too far ahead? His dreams are tomorrow's reality. Just believe in them and one day, you will see him making those things others could never even think of!

    As per the modern western astrologers, Aquarius sun sign is dominated by the ruling planet of Uranus. As far as the Greek mythology is concerned, Uranus was believed to be the personification of the heavens and the night sky. One of the unique traits associated with the Aquarian zodiac sign is that unlike the other planets, it rotates on its sides. The result is that one of its hemispheres is practically bathed in light, while the other is immersed in darkness. It remains surrounded by blue - green clouds, which astronomers have not been able to penetrate till date.
    It takes approximately 84 years for Uranus, discovered only in 1781, to orbit the sun. This means that, on an average, it spends about 7 years in each sign of the zodiac. The planet is associated with the principles of genius, individuality, new and unconventional ideas, discoveries, inventions, and the beginnings of the industrial revolution. Some of the astrologers believe the planet to be the co-ruler of the 11th house, along with Saturn. Qualities of revolution, change, unpredictability and disruption are also connected with it.
    Uranus is thought to rule the circulatory system and ankles. The items that are associated with it include ash, birch, cherry, fig, plum, rowan, apple, lemon and peach blossom and orchid. The lucky colors for those born under the Aquarian sun sign are Aquamarine, Electric Blue and Turquoise tones. The main stone associated with the planet is the Aquamarine and the closest metals are aluminum and uranium. The lucky number for Uranus ruled people is four and the lucky day of the week is Saturday.
