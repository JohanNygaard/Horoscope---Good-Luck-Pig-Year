    The zodiac sign of Capricorn is represented by the symbol of 'The Goat', more precisely a Sea-Goat. Capricorns are not the ones who seek limelight; rather they make up the audience that admires. They are like the tortoise, which moves slowly and still wins the race. A Capricorn finds it extremely easy to merge into a group and will look like one of its original members. He always seems to be surrounded by an air of melancholy and seriousness. He has a soothing voice, pleasant appearance and a convincing personality.
    A Capricorn not only looks harmless, rather he is quite incapable of any serious damage. He takes abuses, strains, failures as well as responsibilities quite calmly, without even batting an eyelid. He knows where he has to go and will persistently move towards his goal. He holds great respect for the people who have excelled in their life, respects authority and honors conventions. One of the most admirable traits of Capricorns is their ability to submit and adapt. They let people go ahead and then find a way to reach the finish line before them.
    A Capricorn's characteristics profile exhibits his quality of keeping the eyes fixed on the aim. A Capricorn does not daydream. He is above envy, obsession, recklessness, rage, abuse, idleness and negligence. As far as he is concerned, all these things are obstacles in the way of success. He is very romantic, but emotions do not make him oblivious of the practicalities of life. Unrestrained passions and emotions make him uncomfortable. At times, a Capricorn may put his foot down and refuse to work till he is given the complete power.
    However, such a situation is pretty rare and the spell won't last long. After some hard jolts, he will back on his track. Capricorns are quite contended with their lives and show respect for age and experience. They mind their own business and would not give advice, unless asked for. In case you do ask for their advice, be ready to get it with some harsh suggestions. He will also expect you to follow it.
    A Capricorn has to be prepared for everything, be it a business venture or an emotional commitment. He never waits for the opportunity to knock twice on the door. He is always waiting for it eagerly. A Capricorn will come across as an extremely sweet person, who is shy, harmless, trustworthy and perhaps, a little obstinate. You confide everything in him and trust him blindly. In the end, he becomes indispensable and you start depending on him. But then, who's complaining? It's always comforting to have his strong shoulders to lean upon. A Capricorn loves taking responsibilities and will carry them out meticulously. With him, you will never have to worry about anything, just remember to let him handle the reins.

    It is very difficult to get close to a Capricorn guy. He is always enclosed within a strong wall, which is not too easy to breach. He is not too gregarious & outgoing, but his personality traits include determination and patience. He has fierce ambitions, which he pursues with a strong resolve. If you look at him casually, it may seem as if he prefers solitude to company. Now, look deeper, inside his heart. Though he doesn't show it, he wants admiration as much as other people. It's just that a Capricorn male is too shy to express his feeling openly.
    Even though it looks as if the compliment hardly moved him an inch, his ears will turn pink and his eyes will carry a sparkling glow. But then, you will have to come close and see all this happen. A careless look will do no good. Another problem with him is that he doesn't know how to handle compliments. If and when he gets any, he becomes too embarrassed and may pass it off as a joke or ignore it altogether. So next time, don't be fooled by him. Tell him that he is delightful, intelligent, good-looking and attractive. He needs to know it.
    The characteristics profile of a Capricorn male makes him a true romantic, though you may come to know about this after the courtship days are almost coming to an end. He prefers to maintain a control over his emotions and displays composed manners, realistic actions and somber intentions. You have to remember that this is not what he is on the inside. Infact, he is very much like a coconut, which seems to be tough on the outside but is extremely soft internally. If you manage to peek inside his heart, you will see a charming person, who loves to dream, likes getting wet in the rain and seeks compliments.
    You just have to become to be one of those few who manage to come close to him. A Capricorn man can provide you with a roof in a storm as well as keep you warm on a freezing winter night. Don't expect him to start reciting poems for you. He is a romantic at heart, but these feelings will not get displayed every now and then. As long as you know what he feels for you, it is enough for him. He doesn't need to tell the world that he loves you. You will have to slowly lure him out of his protective shell and encourage him to show his emotions.
    Show a Capricorn male that you believe in his practical dreams and he will dream some more. Then, one day, he will achieve all of them and much more. At that point of time, you will be there beside him, patting his back and glowing in the warmth of success as well as his subtle love. He is one of the few men who are very serious in their youth and tend to relax with age. When all your old classmates start developing wrinkles, he will look as well as act like a college-going guy.
    He will take you on long drives, when most of the other men are resting their old bones. With Capricorn men, the best part always comes the last, just like the dessert of the meal. You will not have to worry much about loyalty. He literally worships family ties and wouldn't sacrifice them for short, meaningless flings. The family means you and the kids as well as his parents and siblings. It is better if you understand this and respect his other family too. You will be expected to be a good wife, good mother, good daughter-in-law and a good cook.
    Then, you will have to keep your house spic and span, dress well in front of his friends and have impeccable manners. It doesn't matter if you are not pretty, you will have to impress him family and care for them. This is what matters to your Capricorn guy. After everything has been settled, make sure to tell him that you love his family, but it is he you are going to marry and he should never forget this. Since he finds it very difficult to express his emotions, you better start training him in the art of romance at an early stage.
    If you forget to play your part, then better get used to knowing that you are loved, but never being told so. As a father, he will be a little strict and demand respect, discipline and compliance from the kids. In return, he will sacrifice his own happiness to see them smile. Even though he has deep respect for family ties, he will walk out of a marriage if he thinks he made a mistake. If ever it happens, don't expect to be given a second chance. When something is over for him, it's over forever and he never looks back again.
    Initially, romance and love may look like just a part of your Capricorn man's schedule. However, as he grows older, the love will become like an old wine, richer than before. He will always provide you with an umbrella on a rainy day and remain devoted to you as long as he lives. Look beyond that tough exterior, he has a gentle and caring heart - a heart that will love you even when you start walking with a stick. For him, you will always be the girl who made him fall in love and whom he wants to protect from the rest of the world. What if he doesn't say 'I Love You' that often, he does makes you feel loved all the time! Doesn't he?

    It is very difficult to define the characteristics profile of a Capricorn girl exactly. She can be the sexy babe on the beach or a scientist sitting in the laboratory, doing experiments that can save mankind. Whatever she is on the outside, when you look inside you will find a girl who looks for security, authority, respect and position. It is an entirely different matter how she seeks to achieve these goals. It may be as the president of a country or as the wife of an ambitious man. She seeks recognition and it doesn't matter how she gets it.
    A Capricorn female is like that goat, which has to reach the top of the mountain. It doesn't matter what position she starts and how slowly she walks, she will be at the top much before those, who were running in front of her. She will do it with such subtlety that you wouldn't even know when she crossed all the milestones. She has her aims and ambitions, but they don't come before her family. She can enjoy the role of a wife or a mother as much as that of the CEO of the biggest MNC. However, you will have to provide her with equivalent respect and security.
    Almost all the Capricorn women have immaculate etiquettes. They have an inherent sense of social elegance, modesty and conventional look. Though she looks completely calm, composed and balanced, don't think she doesn't have mood swings. She can become really depressed if she thinks that someone has misjudged or ill-treated her. In such a case, she may brood for months at a time. This stems from the fact that she does not feel as secure as she seems to be and fears being ridiculed or laughed at.
    It is advisable not to tease a Capricorn girl; she may take it too literally. Though she may pretend otherwise, she seeks as much compliments as the other girls, probably even more. Show her that you appreciate her and make her feel secure. It will help her in opening up and showing her deliberately controlled passion. A Capricorn girl's personality doesn't include the trait of wishful thinking. She sees only those dreams that can be converted into reality. She enters a boat only when she knows that the waters are safe.
    She will emphasize heavily on social etiquettes and you never see her serving the guests in anything but crystal cutlery. There will always be something fresh about her beauty and she will never ever be unattractive, even when she is wearing those hair-curlers. A Capricorn female will appear to be extremely confident, but inside she is quite unsure about her appearance. You will have to reassure her time and again that she is attractive. She will always be honest and will expect the same from you.
    At the same time, you will have to respect her family. Remember when you marry a Capricorn woman; you marry her family and relatives too. If ever you criticize her family members, better ensure that the criticism is constructive or she will never forgive you. Her love for you will never prevent her from taking care of her family. The plus point of this attitude is that she will be equally considerate towards your family too and give them the same respect as her own fellows.She will never mind if you cancel your holiday trip to pay for dad's operation.
    The home of a Capricorn female will always be sparkling clean, that to with effortless ease. She is a realist and daydreaming is not her idea of passing the time. She has the ability to make even the dullest of surroundings looks warm and attractive, with her earthly passion. She will never stop you from dreaming, as long as there is bread in the house and the dreams have atleast some chances of turning into reality. As a mother, she will teach the kids discipline, economy, practicality, etiquettes and respect for elders. Make her feel loved, protected, needed and cared for and in return, she will support you in realizing your dreams and give you a deep, lasting love!

    Capricorn child has maturity way beyond his age. He may, at times, put you to shame, when you try to do the typical baby talk with him. Right from his childhood, he will be determined and positive in whatever he does. He is not the one to throw unnecessary tantrums, but he will be able to communicate his disapproval or inconvenience with the same force. After getting his message across to you, he will wait for your answer. In case you say no, he will accept it if the thing is not that important.
    However, if it is, he will patiently wait and wear you down till the time you give in to his demands. With time, your Capricorn baby will become more and more organized. His shoes will be in the rack, books in the bookshelf and clothes in the cupboard. He wouldn't be much of a prankster and will be more attached to family. There will be only a few close friends with whom he will share his feelings. After coming home from school, the first thing he will do is his homework. All other things come after his duties and responsibilities.
    The games of Capricorn children are seldom childish. They usually play the part of teacher, doctor, engineer, mommy or daddy. Strangely, they look pretty convincing in these roles too. They are drawn towards art and music and will spend hours indulging in them. A Capricorn child will never waste his time in useless games; rather he will always be involved in something constructive. You will have to practically force him to go outside and play in the sunshine. He may not be a quick learner, but he will always manage to get A-grades in school.
    He will move slowly, but in the end, he will leave the other kids much behind him. A January-born kid is almost always modest and is rarely rude or mean to others. Infact, you may feel that the other kids are bossing him around. Don't worry! He may be patient with such people, but he knows how to take care of himself. He will find one or the other way to get even. A Capricorn child will be interested in the opposite sex, but he will be too shy about it. You will have to handle his feelings very carefully in this area or they may become too closeted.
    Unless pushed too far, a Capricorn child will be very pleasant, tolerant and loving. He will give elders the respect they deserve and help you in everyway he can. You will not have to shout at him, every now and then, to get his room cleaned. He will never venture too far from home and will always come back before you start searching for him. He will be totally practical and will not indulge in the usual childish fantasies. So what if, at times, it feels that he is the parent and you the baby, he will respect you and take care of you when you don't feel so young anymore!

    Capricorn, the Sea Goat, has Saturn as its ruling planet. The planet has been named after the Roman God of Agriculture and the founder of civilization, social order and conformity. Saturn takes approximately 29.5 years to orbit the sun and spends about 2.46 years in each sun sign of the zodiac. It governs various aspects of a person's life, like dreams, aspirations, profession, power and hierarchy. Saturn instills in an individual a sense of duty, discipline and responsibility.

Individuals dominated by this planet concern themselves with future and long term planning. Saturn rules over the skeletal system, skin, teeth, gall bladder spleen and vagus nerve. Till the time Uranus was not discovered, Saturn was regarded as the ruling planet of Aquarius. Infact, even today, many astrologers regard it as dominating both the Capricorn and the Aquarius sun signs.
    Saturn bestows its subjects with qualities like knowledge, understanding, willpower, restraint, resolve and a sense of responsibility. The items associated with it are aspen, elder, elm, pine, poplar, weeping willow, yew, burdock, hemlock, holly and the black and red poppy.
