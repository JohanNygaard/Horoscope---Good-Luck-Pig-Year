    static let taurus_aries: String = """
    An Aries is always in a hurry and has to do everything right now. On the other hand, a Taurean takes his own sweet time to fully understand a situation, form a definite opinion and then, take a particular course of action. The Aries individual is prone to "fall" every now and then, and his Taurus counterpart is bound to react with "I told you so" attitude. This can create some problems as far as the love compatibility between both the zodiacs is concerned. Each one of the duo has to respect the viewpoint of the other.
    If this balance is achieved, both the sun signs can beautifully complement each other. Taurus can give stability and dedication to the impulsiveness of an Aries and Aries can help in bringing some more excitement in the life of a somber Taurus. However, an Aries individual may sometimes become annoyed with the seriousness of a Taurean. The relationship may face a little time problem too. Aries likes to get things done yesterday, while Taurus always plans for the future. If they manage to understand each other's temperament this relationship can go places.
    Aries Man and Taurus Woman
    Astrologically speaking, the match between an Aries man and Taurus woman was never made in heaven. The initial affection may soon lead to nagging and fighting. The reason for this is that he doesn't take life too seriously and she is too practical for his reckless behavior. She may like to spend some time with him alone, in the comfort of their house, which may make him feel tied down. Though the passion of an Aries man may interest a Taurus woman initially, she may ultimately get irritated by his ego and too much boldness.
    Aries Woman and Taurus Man
    A Taurus man loves his home and for him, romance is getting cozy by the hearth. On the other hand, an Aries woman wants to go out every now and then, doing new things and indulging in new activities. There may also be a clash on the money front. He doesn't like spending money on unnecessary things, while she is extravagant beyond limits. As long as the Taurean man learns to not let his seriousness put down the free spirit of an Aries woman, this relationship does have chances of succeeding.

This is because they share some basic personality traits, which makes it easier for them to understand as well as appreciate each other.

Both of them are prone to stick to their individual opinions, even at the cost of domestic harmony.

Since both of them tend to be quite stable and reluctant to indulge in much adventure, the relationship may turn monotonous.

Even though the excitement level in this zodiac match is low, it will be duly compensated by the warmth and comfort that they share. Theirs will one of those fairytale stories where there is always love and affection. There may be occasional bouts of jealousy and possessiveness, but since the Bull is extremely loyal, they will pass over soon.

These Taurean traits go completely opposite the personality of a Gemini, who is extremely restless and does not seem to be able of sitting or standing at a place for too long. At the same time, a Gemini is not capable of consistency. Infact, discrepancy and recklessness are like his second nature. This may create a lot of problems between the two signs, especially when they are in a relationship.
    On the positive side, Taurus will feel attracted to the witty nature, intelligence and mental aptitude of Gemini. The latter, on the other hand, will respect the strength and resolve of the Bull. At the same time, the Bull may become fed up with the inability of the Gemini to, first, make a commitment and, then, stick to it. This may lead to compatibility problems in this love match. The restlessness of the latter will also go against the calmness of the former.
    While a Taurus will take his decision alone, Gemini will always need to talk to someone, before reaching on a conclusion. Gemini is a free bird and does not like to be tied and this is exactly what the Bull will try to do. The jealousy and possessiveness of a Taurean will be resented by a Gemini. If they both manage to balance out the differences, this can be a good match. Gemini will teach Taurus the meaning of letting go, while the Bull will teach him some consistency.
    Taurus Man and Gemini Woman
    Gemini woman will almost instantly be drawn to a Taurus man. However, the long term stability of this relationship is open to question. As far as the good part is concerned, the Bull will be fascinated by her never-ending energy, outgoing personality and self-confidence. But, as they move towards settling down, he will want her to show a more rational, and less wild, behavior. His possessiveness may throttle her vivacious nature. If they do manage to sort out the differences, this will be an excellent match, with her energy providing the much-needed spark to his steady life and his steadiness toning down her unpredictability.

    The match between a Taurus woman and a Gemini man was not made in heaven. His hyperactivity, impatience and recklessness will not go down well with her need for constancy. At the same time, the flirtatious nature of a Gemini man may compel her to be jealous and possessive in the extreme. He may find her too predictable and devoid of any sense of adventure. This isn't exactly a sign for a lovely, romantic liaison. Beyond the first date, there are little chances of success, unless and until both of them make great adjustments.

    The Taurean quality of stubbornness is also a part of the characteristics profile of a Leo. Both of them have a strong determination and stick to a decision once they have made it. This zodiac match will, most probably, show signs of permanence, firmness and devotion. However, their different personal dispositions and incompatible tastes may lead to some problems. The Lion is a people's person, who loves an audience and its attention. On the other hand, the Bull is a bit reserved and prefers to be only with the few people he is close to. Even the extravagant ways of the former may not go down well with the latter.

It may take quite a lot of efforts on the part of both the individuals, but this match can definitely workout. She will have to get used to his stubborn and bossy attitude, while he will have to let her handle the reins at times.

    Aries as well as Virgo are extremely honest and have a preference for the absolute, unvarnished truth. Though, at times, the Ram may find it a little difficult to swallow the harsh criticism of Virgo. Another major area of difference between the two zodiac signs is that Aries is not one of those who take each and every step carefully. Rather, he is the one who does something first and thinks of the consequences later. On the other extreme, a Virgo is likely to think over the entire scenario atleast one thousand times and then take a single step forward.
    The relationship may also face compatibility problems as far as the financial aspect is concerned. In this context, Virgo is too cautious and Aries is too extravagant. The Ram may also find it difficult to adjust his impulsive nature with the practicality and stability of a Virgo. He is concerned about the results, not the exact method that is to be followed for the same. To ensure that this love match works smoothly, Virgo will have to control his criticizing and nagging nature somewhat and Aries will have to learn to rein in his impulsiveness.
    Aries Man and Virgo Woman
    Aries man will find it a little, rather quite, difficult to cope up with the nitpicking Virgo woman. For him, criticism is criticism, whether it is done in good taste or bad taste. He will never ever follow rules and conventions and wouldn't take nicely when she tells him what to do and what not to do. The relationship is most likely to be full of arguments and if both of them do not manage to bridge the differences in their personalities, then, things will get difficult. There may be some chances if she learns to control her nagging and he tries to limit his recklessness.
    Aries Woman and Virgo Man
    It will be relatively easy for an Aries woman and a Virgo man to get involved in a relationship. The difficulty will be encountered in keeping the spark alive. Both the individuals are entirely opposite in their temperament. He is too organized and her nature is full of spontaneity and carelessness. She lives in the present, he lives in the future. There will hardly be any Virgo man who has not saved anything for his old age. Too much adventure and thrill is surely not his cup of tea. However, if they do manage to bridge the gaps, this match is really worth it.

    A Libra is prone to weigh the pros and cons too much before taking decision. An Aries first takes the decision and then thinks over its consequences. Libra will always look at both the sides of the coin and will take the opinion of others too. The Ram is more likely to stick to his own opinion and will show complete indifference to other people's views. Once this basic difference is overcome, the zodiac match of an Aries and a Libra will have an extremely good compatibility. Aries will also have to respect the Libra and return his love and warmth.
    Their relationship will be based on strong emotional attraction. The laid back and quiet nature of the Libran will perfectly complement the lively personality of the Ram, who is always looking for new ways of excitement and adventure. Libra might teach Aries the importance of patience and looking atleast once before leaping. On the other hand, Aries will teach him the importance of standing up for himself and instill in him a sense of adventure. Though the two are unique in their own way, if small adjustments are made, their pair will be just perfect.
    Aries Man and Libra Woman
    Aries man and Libra woman may experience instant attraction when they meet for the first time. This attraction may last a little longer too, but whether it lasts for an entire time or not is an entirely different question. Both of them love intellectual stimulation, are extroverts, love to talk and face no difficulty in interacting with people. However, their temperament may be different somewhat; actually quite a lot. Her indecisiveness may make him lose his temper, while his aggressiveness might disturb her inner harmony. Here, adjustment is the keyword.

    Libra man takes a lot of time to decide and the same holds true when he is deciding about his life partner. This vacillation will make the truly romantic Ram move away, rather than towards, the relationship. She will also find it difficult to cope up with his forever-changing opinions. At the same time, he will find her impulsiveness totally opposite to his laid-back pace. On the positive side, a Libra will always be there to protect the Aries woman whenever she gets hurt because of her impetuosity. He will also serenade her beautifully and there will always be those romantic long drives to look forward to.

A Scorpio needs to feel totally secure in a relationship and has to have an intense bond with his partner. An Aries, on the other hand, does not like too much closeness.
    Another problem may crop up when both of them get angry and fight. An Aries finds it easier to take out his anger and then forget about whatever happened and move on.

A positive aspect of this zodiac match is that they will work pretty well as a team. Scorpio will love the aggressiveness of an Aries and he will in return never suspect the secret ways of the former.

    The self-confidence, strong will power and aggressiveness of an Aries man may draw a Scorpio woman.

Then, another negative trait is that they find it difficult to stick to anything for too long, be it professional or personal life.

The tendency of a Gemini to think from the mind, rather than the heart, may also create compatibility problems in this love match.

Though there may be a few differences every now and then, none of them will be too great to adversely affect their compatibility.
    The lonely or detached spells of the Water Bearer will never affect a Gemini. Infact, during those times, he will be too busy enjoying his own freedom. He will also adore the originality and inventiveness of the former. An Aquarian, on the other hand, will love Gemini's unpredictability and independence. Nevertheless, the Water Bearer will have to learn the tricks of romance, so that the brimming passion of a Gemini doesn't starts diminishing. Except for a few hiccups, this zodiac match is one of the strongest ones.

Making plans is not their cup of tea and with them; every thing has to be spontaneous. Adhering to rules and plans makes them irritated. An Aquarian man and a Gemini woman understand each other perfectly and do not need words to know their partner's feelings.

Even too much emotion can make practical thinking quite difficult. A Cancer-Cancer love match can go either way. Either, it will be very loving, comforting and cozy, or it will be extremely sarcastic, bitter, clingy and sardonic.
    The way it turns out to be depends on the efforts each of them is ready to put. One will have to take charge when the other becomes too emotional or too depressed. If both of them react the same way, at the same time, there is no doubt that the relationship will turn into a disaster. As long as the sailing is perfect, there will be no problems. But, the moment going gets tough, things will start going topsy-turvy. One of them has to be more assertive and more practical than the other, if they want to make things work.

If these issues are not worked upon early, their relationship is bound to get doomed. Two Cancerian partners will care deeply for each other, but then, they will also demand too much from each other.

She is very erratic and unpredictable and has little time to dream as much as he does. However, both of them are romantic to the core and have passion embedded in their nature. Their love match will be a very romantic one, but there can be no guarantee of stability. The problem is that he is very emotional and she, very intellectual. And this may create more than just little problems between the two.
