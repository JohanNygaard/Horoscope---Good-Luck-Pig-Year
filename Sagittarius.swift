    Sagittarius has the symbol of 'The Archer'. The people born under this zodiac sign just don't know how to give compliments. Their compliment will be like "You are looking so good in this dress. I bet no one can make out that huge beer belly" of yours. It's not that they are trying to offend you or something. A Sagittarian tries his best to be cheerful and friendly, but fails miserably. On top of that, he won't understand why you are so annoyed with him. It will help to remember that his personality traits do not include wickedness and he never meant to insult you.
    Even though his words seemed to be too harsh, they were spoken in total innocence. Even when he tries to correct his mistake, he will add to the damage already done. The icing on the cake is that a Sagittarian believes that he is the most diplomatic person on the face of this planet. Sagittarius people are very sharp and are an interesting fusion of humor, intellect and sizzling drive. Vices like deceit and dishonesty do not form a part of their characteristics profile. They are restless and find it difficult to be still for too long.
    They love animals and take good care of them. A typical Sagittarius fears nothing and, at times, may get attracted to danger. He is not the one to keep his thoughts to himself. Infact, what is in his mind and heart will instantly be on his lips. He is frank and innocent like a child. He has many friends and all of them are truly loyal to him. Nobody can remain angry with a Sagittarius for too long. This is because even though he may have said some, not so nice, things to you, he never had the intention of hurting you. He was completely oblivious of its effects and you know it.
    If he ever sees you down, he will be the first person to cheer you up. It's just that he miserably fails in that too. However, every now and then, Sagittarians will turn up with such a compliment that will instantly lift up your spirits. Then, you will fall in love with them again. They are completely extroverted, very talkative and totally straightforward. A Sagittarian will usually come across as a very cheerful and pleasant person. However, he has a violent temper also, which is aroused when people try to push him around or try to get too close.
    An unfair accusation or an insult to his honesty also ignites his temper. After his temper has cooled down, he will try to make amends and even apply ointment at the eye he blackened. Sagittarians are rebels at heart and adhering to social norms is not their cup of tea. They love to perform before an audience and usually seek a career in the show business. Travel excites them and religion interests them. Just like a child, a Sagittarius is naive, fearless and optimistic and dislikes responsibilities.
    Too much boundation can make him unhappy as well as rebellious. Mood spells are completely alien to him. Almost every Sagittarian was born with a gambling streak and needs to be very careful about the same. He easily falls in love, but commitment and marriage is something, which he is not too comfortable with. He will go on thinking about it, considering it thoroughly and may still end up with a mistake. Some of the most unpleasant personality traits of a Sagittarius include sarcasm, weirdness and the inability to keep a secret.
    However, almost all of these traits can be overcome, if he is determined. He will give you a loan, without even bothering to ask for its repayment. Lonely, destitute and helpless always get his help. Sagittarians have excellent memories and can remember even the smallest incidents of their lives, with the minutest of details. At the same time, they can easily forget things like where they left their car keys or wallet or handkerchief. A Sagittarius is incapable of deceit and if at all he tells a lie, he always ends up getting caught. He makes you laugh, is fun to be with, brightens up the day and can make even the impossible dreams come true.

    There are very less chances of finding a Sagittarius man alone. In most probability, you will always find him surrounded by a crowd. It will be entirely upto you to move away that crowd and get closer to him. He is also very optimistic about life and this optimism may sometimes border around blind faith. This attitude leads him to trust almost everyone and, more often than not, he ends up getting hurt. A Sagittarian male will always be running after some high dreams, which probably no one even thought of before.
    While running, he often fails to see the puddles, falls flat on his face and then, gets hurt. It does not mean that the dreams are not practical. He would have investigated them thoroughly and they will be realistic too, even though the world is not yet ready for them. The problem is that in his enthusiasm, he trusts everyone and some of those people thrash his dreams, even before he could try to realize them. However, a Sagittarius guy has an exceptionally good luck, which seldom runs out.
    Even though his dreams don't turn out to be the way he planned, he'll always end up with something useful. There may be times when he returns empty-handed, but then, he has the ability to forget this and move on again. Same is the case with love also. Sagittarian men tend to move over lost love with as much ease as lost dreams. When they form friendships, they tend to look much beyond the external appearances. The heart matters to them more than the looks. A Sagittarius man doesn't have many enemies.
    Even those he might have hurt with his frank opinions and comments usually realize his harmless intentions. He may lack tact, diplomacy and consideration, but he is never deliberately mean. He doesn't know the meaning of sugarcoated truth and his statements will always be straightforward, direct and to the point. Still, people never go away from him forever. They will come back once the anger has subsided and then, be his close friends once again. A Sagittarius male seldom forms long-lasting relationships.
    Most of them would be casual and at time, they may be promiscuous too. However, he is never dishonest in a relationship and will never say 'I Love You', even he doesn't mean it. He will tell you all about his previous relationships as well as what he expects out of the present one with you. He seldom lies, but his flirtation may sometimes be confused with commitment and result in a proposal from the girl. In case this happens, he will definitely think over it and most probably, agree to the marriage, which will be destined to lead to divorce.
    A Sagittarian guy is a flirt, but he does not always form licentious relationships. He may be looking for a platonic partner, with whom to roam around and have fun. At times, his friendliness may also be confused with flirtations. If you want to enter into a serous relationship with such a man, remember that he looks for a woman with brains. Intelligence turns him on and bimbos are a strict no-no. After you have managed to win a Sagittarian man's love, give him freedom. In exchange, never let him curb your independence.
    Don't try to bind him and please never be suspicious of him. He is way too honest to be disloyal to you and he expects you to be sincere and truthful in return. Boredom makes him miserable and he wants a wife who is as enthusiastic about life as he is. Always encourage his weirdest of dreams and when he is not there, keep yourself busy with other things. Once you become sure of his commitment, throw subtle hints about marriage. However, never be the one to propose or suggest it.
    You can even say that if the relationship doesn't lead to marriage, you can still be good friends. In all the probability, your Sagittarian man will propose marriage and make it work too. He will never let his family members or relatives interfere in your life and you will be expected to do the same. Never ever doubt his integrity or you will have to bear his nasty temper. When and if he is wrong, he will always come and admit it. He believes that truth and honesty is the basis of all relationships and he will make sure to follow this.
    A Sagittarius man wants his wife to mingle with people just as he does. If you are a little reserved, try to come out of your inhibitions. He will never try to put curbs on you and he will not mind even if you work after marriage. With him, prepare yourself for some forthright criticism. Infact, by this time, you should have gotten used to it. He may take time to get used to kids, but once he does, he will become their closest buddy and give them lots of love and affection. Don't neglect him when the children come. He was the first love of your life and should remain so. Just be there when he trips and will always be there for you in return!

    A Sagittarius woman lacks tact and her flat, on-the-face statements may make you feeling like running away from her. Then, suddenly, she will say something so charming that you will feel as if you are on the seventh heaven. There, you go again! You will be trapped in her charm once more. Once you have been enamored by a Sagittarius girl, you will be staying with her for a long time. She is pleasant, friendly, outspoken and very talkative. Her forthrightness comes form the fact that she has no illusions about the world.
    She sees it exactly as it is and says what she sees. At times, you may wish that she were not so honest. But then, she would be like any other girl, wouldn't she? In all probability, you will not like it. A Sagittarian female is very optimistic, but she is not irrational. She will judge the entire situation as per the facts, analyze its probable outcome and still believe that things will get better. Usually, she is very calm and composed. However, when you become rude to her or offend her, she may become like the fire-spitting dragon.
    Sagittarius women are quite independent and love their freedom. They are attached to their family, but not too much. If you want to get something done from a Sagittarian female, just ask her; don't order. She will never ever do it. She is your better half and don't you dare forget that. On the other hand, she doesn't want a sissy for a husband or boyfriend. He has to be a real man, who has his ego and won't stand for nonsense. So, you will be expected to balance politeness with firmness.
    I know it's difficult - but then, since when was winning someone easy. With a Sagittarius girl, you will never have to guess. She says what she thinks and how she acts shows what she feels. This bluntness may cost her heavily at times, even to the point of ending the relationship. Still, she would act as if she's not hurt at all and it is just one of the many harmless flirtations she's had. People will even believe all this, while inside she will be weeping and nursing her wounds. All this time, she will be analyzing what went wrong and when.
    The word 'marriage' makes a Sagittarian female a little nervous and you will need to tempt her in order to make her settle down. She is a little hard to catch and tends to be one of the boys all the time. That doesn't mean she looks or acts like a man! Infact, she is as female as any other girl is. The society and its norms do not matter to her. She can never be the hypocrite that some people are and tend to wiggle a few tongues. Her honesty and brusqueness further add to the negative opinions.
    Don't be fooled by them. Look deep inside a Sagittarius female and you will find a woman who is so enthusiastic about life and who trusts easily. Infact, this extreme belief makes her heart vulnerable and defenseless. It gets broken too often, but then, she knows how to move on with life. You will be tempted to care for her. It's natural. There are hardly any people who can resist the bright and charming disposition of a Sagittarius girl. She will not be too good with money and will most probably be on the extravagant side.
    She is very sentimental and emotional, though it seems otherwise. It just that, where her feelings are concerned, she becomes too shy. After marriage, your house will always remain sparkling clean, even if you don't have a maid to do that. She cannot stand sloppiness, it doesn't appeal to her sensibilities. She may not be too good at cooking, but she will also not burn your egg every day. A Sagittarian girl may pass the most sarcastic comments when she is angry, but she will forget the resentment soon enough. Then, she won't understand why are you so upset.
    As a mother, she will be very friendly with the kids. Infact, she will be more of a chum, than a mom. Only, you will have to teach them to take her bluntness with a pinch of salt. Apart from that, she will be wonderful and make them as independent as she is. She will be a lovely hostess to guests and make them feel at home. Just let her be what she is. Don't try to change her and don't curb her individuality. She will brighten your life with her optimism, boost you with loyalty, trust you blindly and shower her affection on you. She will encourage you to see dreams and help you in making them come true!

    A Sagittarius child will be very friendly from a very tender age itself. You will see him waving at people enthusiastically, wishing that they would love him for what he is. His small little heart will break from disappointment if someone doesn't wave back. He will be like a small clown, who is jovial, pleasant and mischievous. A Sagittarius baby will never like being alone, even when he has to sleep. He will be the most comfortable amongst people who are talking, laughing and playing around. Infact, he loves to be around cheerful people.
    If he is not given this kind of environment while growing up, he may turn a little cynical towards life. Most of the Sagittarian children start drawing away from family ties, as they grow older. Formality is something they cannot understand and honesty is something they will never lack in. Speaking plain, harsh truth is one of the basic personality traits of a Sagittarius child. You will have to remind him to tone down the brutality of the truth a bit. He has a very inquisitive mind and your every order must be backed by a sound, reasonable logic.
    If you cannot do that, forget teaching him anything. Even if you try to do that, you get back defiance in the process. Never ever say a lie in front of your Sagittarius baby or you will make a dent in the respect he has for you. If you are right, stand your ground and give him a reason for it. If you are wrong, accept it rather than telling a lie. He can easily know that you are not telling the truth. One thing you will find in excess in the characteristics profile of Sagittarian children is curiosity. The word 'Why?' will be there in almost all the sentences.
    They wake up with a question in their mind and sleep with a query on their list. Shouting won't help; it is better to give them truthful, sometimes a little distorted, answers. A Sagittarian child will not do something just because that is the social norm. You will have to convince him with sound logic. If something is not helping him or adding to his welfare, you can be sure that he will never do it.
    In his childhood, always be prepared with medicines, antiseptics and band-aids. He is prone to accidents and you will need them every now and then. He needs his freedom and may go away from home earlier than the other kids. So, it's better to be prepared for the scenario. If you scold him on his ways, he may not come home even on weekends. However, if you try to understand his ways and show a little patience, he will return every other day, even bring his friends along and spend lots of time with you.
    Romantic expeditions usually start early in case of Sagittarians and you may need to introduce them to the world of opposite sex much before other children. They are not too good with finances and you will have to teach them its importance the hard way. Don't fill their pockets when they spend the entire week's pocket money in a single day. Slowly, they will learn. A Sagittarian child is usually restless and you will have to keep him constantly involved in one thing or the other. Dull things will make him sad and disinterested.
    Religion will interest him and he may become deeply involved in it. He will also be interested in roaming around the world and putting his idealism to work. A Sagittarian has to have a cause, without which he may become a lost puppy. He believes in the stars and their miraculous powers. He will never become too dependent on you, nor will he be totally detached. Let him see his dreams, run on the wet grass and wink at the girl next door. Just wave at him when he looks at you enthusiastically from far, he will surely come back to you again!
